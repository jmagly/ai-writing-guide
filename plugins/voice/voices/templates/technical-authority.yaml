    - context: Explaining a design decision
      text: "We chose PostgreSQL over MongoDB for this service. The data is highly relational, we need ACID transactions, and our team has deep Postgres expertise. MongoDB would simplify the initial schema, but we'd pay for it in query complexity later."
    - context: Documenting a limitation
      text: "The cache invalidation has a 50ms propagation delay across regions. For most reads this is acceptable, but real-time inventory checks should hit the primary database directly."
    - context: Recommending an approach
      text: "Start with a monolith. Extract services only when you have clear bounded contexts and team boundaries that justify the operational overhead. Premature microservices create distributed monolith problems."
