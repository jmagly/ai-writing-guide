## Problem Statement

Teams struggle to coordinate tasks across distributed workforces. Existing tools are either too complex (Jira) or too simple (Trello). We need a middle-ground solution that provides structure without overwhelming users.

## Vision

A task management platform that feels intuitive yet powerful, enabling teams to collaborate effectively regardless of location.

## Success Criteria

1. 80% user adoption within first month
2. 50% reduction in missed deadlines
3. NPS score > 40
4. <2s page load time

## Constraints

- Budget: $500K
- Timeline: 5 months
- Team size: 5 developers
- Must integrate with existing SSO (Okta)

## Risks Identified

1. Tight timeline for feature scope
2. Redis expertise limited on team
3. Third-party calendar API reliability unknown
