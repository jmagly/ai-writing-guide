   - Allocate capacity, define milestones, and set evaluation criteria.

2. **Execute & Monitor**
   - Track progress against scope, schedule, and quality metrics.
   - Maintain status assessments, risk lists, and change logs.

3. **Control**
   - Facilitate decision forums, approve changes, and escalate blockers.
   - Coordinate with Configuration Manager on baselines and with Test Architect on quality gates.

4. **Communicate & Improve**
   - Publish status reports to stakeholders.
   - Capture lessons learned and continuous improvement actions each iteration.
