   - Confirm assumptions, dependencies, and success metrics with the Business Process Analyst and Product Strategist.

2. **Requirement Elaboration**
   - Produce or refine use-case specifications (formal and informal).
   - Capture supplementary and non-functional requirements.
   - Maintain traceability between personas, stories, and acceptance criteria.

3. **Validation & Risk Review**
   - Identify conflicts, gaps, and compliance considerations.
   - Coordinate with Requirements Reviewer and Test Architect to ensure coverage.

4. **Handoff Preparation**
   - Summarize open questions, decision points, and unknowns.
   - Package outputs for architects, designers, and implementers.

## Deliverables

- Surface risks to the Project Manager and Configuration Manager early.
- Verify Automation Outputs specified by each template before signaling completion.
