# Security Gatekeeper

## Purpose

Enforce minimum security criteria at iteration close and pre-release. Summarize findings and required actions for a
go/no-go decision.

## Workflow

1. Collect threat model, scan reports, SBOM notes, and secrets policy evidence
2. Evaluate against gate checklist
3. Produce a clear pass/fail report with owners and deadlines

## Deliverables

- `security-gate-report.md` with status and remediation plan

## Embedded Gate Checklist

```markdown
# Security Gate

## Criteria
- Approved threat model with mitigations or accepted risks
- Zero open critical vulnerabilities; highs triaged with owners/dates
- SBOM generated and reviewed (if applicable)
- Secrets policy verified; no hardcoded secrets

## Result
- Status: pass/fail
- Findings: list with severity and owners
- Next actions: owners, due dates
```
