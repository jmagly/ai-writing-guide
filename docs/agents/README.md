# Agents

## Purpose
This directory holds shared agent playbooks used across projects. Agents are universal and may be
specialized by subfolder.

## Layout
- `./` — General-purpose agents (architecture, PM, devops, testing, etc.)
- `sdlc/` — SDLC-focused agents (orchestrator, governance, security, reliability)

## Quick links
- `docs/agents/sdlc/` — SDLC agent suite

## Maintenance
- Keep agent responsibilities and deliverables current
- Prefer embedded templates for agents that generate standard artifacts (e.g., RACI Expert)
