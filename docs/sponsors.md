## Roko Network

**Website:** [https://roko.network](https://roko.network)

**The Temporal Layer for Web3**

Roko Network provides enterprise-grade timing infrastructure for blockchain applications, enabling developers to build decentralized systems with nanosecond-level precision. By bringing IEEE 1588 PTP-grade synchronization to Web3, Roko solves one of distributed computing's most challenging problems: reliable time coordination across trustless networks.

**What They Do:**

- Deliver precision timing infrastructure for blockchain applications
- Enable time-sensitive smart contracts and DeFi protocols
- Provide developer tools for building temporal-aware dApps
- Bridge traditional enterprise timing standards with Web3 innovation

**Why It Matters:**

Many blockchain applications require precise timing—from DeFi protocols that need accurate price feeds to gaming applications that demand fair, verifiable randomness. Roko Network makes these use cases possible by providing the timing layer that Web3 has been missing.

## Selfient

**Website:** [https://selfient.xyz](https://selfient.xyz)

**No-Code Smart Contracts for Everyone**

Selfient democratizes Web3 by making blockchain-based agreements accessible to everyone—not just developers. Their no-code platform enables creators, freelancers, and businesses to create enforceable smart contracts with automated escrow and payment processing, all without writing a single line of code.

**What They Do:**

- Transform traditional agreements into immutable, blockchain-based contracts
- Provide decentralized escrow that holds funds until conditions are met
- Support milestone-based, one-time, and recurring payment structures
- Deploy contracts on Polygon for low fees and fast transactions
- Eliminate intermediaries from business transactions

**Why It Matters:**

The promise of smart contracts has always been trustless, self-executing agreements—but the technical barrier to entry kept most people locked out. Selfient changes that. Freelancers can guarantee payment upon deliverable completion. Businesses can automate complex multi-party agreements. Everyone benefits from the security and transparency of blockchain without needing to understand Solidity.
