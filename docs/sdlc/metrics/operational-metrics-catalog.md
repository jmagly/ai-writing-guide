# Operational Metrics Catalog

## Purpose

Define metrics for tracking production reliability, infrastructure health, incident management, and cost efficiency.

**Scope**: SLO/SLI metrics, infrastructure, incidents, costs

**Target Audience**: Reliability Engineers, DevOps Engineers, Infrastructure Engineers, Operations Managers

**Integration**: Reference this catalog when defining SLOs, incident response, and capacity planning

---

## Overview

Operational metrics answer: **Is it running well?**

**Categories**:

1. **SLO/SLI Metrics** - Service level objectives and indicators (5 metrics)
2. **Infrastructure Metrics** - Resource utilization and health (4 metrics)
3. **Incident Metrics** - Response and recovery effectiveness (4 metrics)
4. **Cost Metrics** - Economic efficiency (3 metrics)

**Philosophy**: Reliability is a feature. Measure, monitor, improve.

**Critical Balance**: Reliability vs velocity. 100% uptime costs infinite resources.

---

## SLO/SLI Metrics

### Background

**SLI (Service Level Indicator)**: Quantifiable metric measuring service behavior

**SLO (Service Level Objective)**: Target value or range for SLI

**SLA (Service Level Agreement)**: Business contract with consequences if SLO missed

**Error Budget**: Allowed downtime before SLO breached (1 - SLO)

**Example**: SLO = 99.9% uptime → Error budget = 0.1% = 43 minutes/month

---

### Metric 1: Availability (Uptime)

**Definition**: Percentage of time service is operational

**Why It Matters**: Downtime = lost revenue, user frustration

**Data Source**: Monitoring system (Pingdom, Datadog, Prometheus)

**Collection Method**:

**Prometheus Query**:

```promql
# Availability over last 30 days
(1 - (sum(rate(http_requests_total{status=~"5.."}[30d])) /
      sum(rate(http_requests_total[30d])))) * 100
```

**SQL (from monitoring database)**:

```sql
SELECT
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE status = 'up') AS up_checks,
  COUNT(*) AS total_checks,
  ROUND(100.0 * COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE status = 'up') / COUNT(*), 3) AS availability
FROM health_checks
WHERE timestamp >= NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'
```

**Formula**: (Uptime / Total time) × 100

**Calculation Methods**:

1. **Request-based**: (Successful requests / Total requests) × 100
2. **Time-based**: (Minutes up / Total minutes) × 100

**Common SLO Targets**:

| SLO Level | Uptime % | Downtime per Month | Downtime per Year |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|------------------|
| 90% | 90.000% | 3 days | 36.5 days |
| 99% | 99.000% | 7.2 hours | 3.65 days |
| 99.9% ("three nines") | 99.900% | 43 minutes | 8.76 hours |
| 99.95% | 99.950% | 22 minutes | 4.38 hours |
| 99.99% ("four nines") | 99.990% | 4.3 minutes | 52.6 minutes |
| 99.999% ("five nines") | 99.999% | 26 seconds | 5.26 minutes |

**Recommended Targets by Service Type**:

- Internal tools: 99% (7 hours/month)
- SaaS products: 99.9% (43 minutes/month)
- Mission-critical: 99.95-99.99% (4-22 minutes/month)
- Payment systems: 99.99%+ (< 5 minutes/month)

**Thresholds**:

- Warning: Approaching error budget (90% consumed)
- Alert: SLO breached
- Critical: Multiple SLOs breached simultaneously

**Recommended Review Cadence**:

- Monitor: Continuously (real-time dashboard)
- Review: Weekly (error budget consumption)
- Report: Monthly (SLO compliance report)

**Related Metrics**:

- Error budget remaining
- Time since last incident
- Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF)

---

### Metric 2: Latency (Response Time)

**Definition**: Time to process request (p50, p95, p99)

**Why It Matters**: Slow responses = poor user experience, lost conversions

**Data Source**: Application logs, APM tools (Datadog, New Relic), load balancers

**Collection Method**:

**Prometheus Query**:

```promql
# p95 latency over last 5 minutes
histogram_quantile(0.95, sum(rate(http_request_duration_seconds_bucket[5m])) by (le))
```

**SQL (from application logs)**:

```sql
SELECT
  PERCENTILE_CONT(0.50) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY response_time_ms) AS p50_latency,
  PERCENTILE_CONT(0.95) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY response_time_ms) AS p95_latency,
  PERCENTILE_CONT(0.99) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY response_time_ms) AS p99_latency
FROM request_logs
WHERE timestamp >= NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour'
```

**Formula**: Measure request start to response complete

**Why Percentiles, Not Average**:

- Average hides outliers (one slow request skews average)
- p50 (median): Half of users see this or better
- p95: 95% of users see this or better
- p99: 99% of users see this or better (catches tail latency)

**Common SLO Targets**:

| Service Type | p50 | p95 | p99 |
|-------------|-----|-----|-----|
| API endpoints | < 100ms | < 300ms | < 1s |
| Web pages | < 500ms | < 2s | < 5s |
| Database queries | < 10ms | < 50ms | < 200ms |
| Background jobs | < 1s | < 10s | < 60s |

**Thresholds**:

- Warning: p95 > target for 5 minutes
- Alert: p99 > 2× target
- Critical: p50 > target (widespread issue)

**Recommended Review Cadence**:

- Monitor: Continuously (real-time)
- Alert: When threshold exceeded
- Review: Weekly (latency trends)

**Optimization Levers**:

- Caching (Redis, CDN)
- Database indexing
- Query optimization
- Horizontal scaling
- Code profiling (identify hotspots)

---

### Metric 3: Error Rate

**Definition**: Percentage of requests resulting in errors

**Why It Matters**: Errors indicate bugs, infrastructure issues, or capacity problems

**Data Source**: Application logs, APM tools

**Collection Method**:

**Prometheus Query**:

```promql
# Error rate (5xx responses) over last 5 minutes
sum(rate(http_requests_total{status=~"5.."}[5m])) /
sum(rate(http_requests_total[5m])) * 100
```

**SQL (from logs)**:

```sql
SELECT
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE status_code >= 500) AS errors,
  COUNT(*) AS total_requests,
  ROUND(100.0 * COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE status_code >= 500) / COUNT(*), 3) AS error_rate
FROM request_logs
WHERE timestamp >= NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour'
```

**Formula**: (Error requests / Total requests) × 100

**Error Categories**:

- 4xx errors: Client errors (bad requests, auth failures)
- 5xx errors: Server errors (bugs, crashes, timeouts)

**Common SLO Targets**:

| Service Type | Error Rate SLO |
|-------------|---------------|
| Public APIs | < 0.1% (99.9% success) |
| Internal services | < 0.5% |
| Background jobs | < 1% |

**Thresholds**:

- Warning: Error rate > 0.5% for 5 minutes
- Alert: Error rate > 1%
- Critical: Error rate > 5% (widespread failure)

**Recommended Review Cadence**:

### Metric 4: Saturation (Resource Utilization)

**Definition**: Percentage of resource capacity consumed

**Why It Matters**: High saturation → performance degradation, outages

**Data Source**: Infrastructure monitoring (Prometheus, CloudWatch, Datadog)

**Collection Method**:

**Prometheus Queries**:

```promql
# CPU saturation
avg(rate(node_cpu_seconds_total{mode!="idle"}[5m])) by (instance) * 100

# Memory saturation
(1 - (node_memory_MemAvailable_bytes / node_memory_MemTotal_bytes)) * 100

# Disk saturation
(node_filesystem_size_bytes - node_filesystem_free_bytes) / node_filesystem_size_bytes * 100
```

**Formula**: (Resource used / Resource capacity) × 100

**Targets**:

| Resource | Warning | Critical |
|----------|---------|----------|
| CPU | 70% | 85% |
| Memory | 80% | 90% |

def calculate_error_budget(slo_target, actual_sli, time_period_days):
    """
    slo_target: e.g., 99.9 (for 99.9% uptime)
    actual_sli: e.g., 99.95 (actual uptime)
    time_period_days: e.g., 30
    """
    error_budget_pct = 100 - slo_target
    actual_error_pct = 100 - actual_sli

    error_budget_remaining_pct = error_budget_pct - actual_error_pct
    error_budget_consumed_pct = (actual_error_pct / error_budget_pct) * 100

    minutes_in_period = time_period_days * 24 * 60
    error_budget_minutes = (error_budget_pct / 100) * minutes_in_period
    consumed_minutes = (actual_error_pct / 100) * minutes_in_period
    remaining_minutes = error_budget_minutes - consumed_minutes

    return {
        'error_budget_pct': error_budget_pct,
        'consumed_pct': error_budget_consumed_pct,
        'remaining_minutes': remaining_minutes,
        'total_budget_minutes': error_budget_minutes
    }

# Example:
# SLO = 99.9%, Actual = 99.95%, Period = 30 days
# Error budget = 0.1% = 43 minutes
# Actual errors = 0.05% = 22 minutes
# Budget consumed = 50%, remaining = 21 minutes
```

**Formula**:

```
Error Budget = (1 - SLO) × Time Period
Budget Consumed = (1 - Actual SLI) × Time Period
Budget Remaining = Error Budget - Budget Consumed
```

**Targets**:

| Budget Status | Action |
|--------------|--------|
| > 50% remaining | Prioritize features (move fast) |
| 25-50% remaining | Balance features and reliability |
| < 25% remaining | Slow down, focus on reliability |
| 0% remaining (exhausted) | Freeze features, fix reliability issues |

**Thresholds**:

- Warning: 75% budget consumed
- Alert: 90% budget consumed
- Critical: Budget exhausted (SLO breached)

**Recommended Review Cadence**:

- Monitor: Daily
- Review: Weekly (error budget burn rate)
- Report: Monthly (SLO report)

**Error Budget Policy** (define in advance):

- Budget healthy: Ship features, take calculated risks
- Budget low: Increase testing, slow releases
- Budget exhausted: Feature freeze, focus on reliability
