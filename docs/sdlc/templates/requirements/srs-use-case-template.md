## 1 Introduction

> Outline the purpose, scope, terminology, references, and organization of this SRS.

### 1.1 Purpose

### 1.2 Scope

### 1.3 Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations

### 1.4 References

### 1.5 Overview

## 2 Overall Description

> Provide background information and assumptions for the subsystem or feature being specified.

### 2.1 Use-Case Model Survey

> Summarize the relevant portion of the use-case model (actors, use-case list, diagrams). Reference external surveys or reports when available.

### 2.2 Assumptions and Dependencies

> Document technical, organizational, or scheduling assumptions and dependencies that influence these requirements.

## 3 Specific Requirements

> Capture detailed requirements using referenced use-case reports and supplementary specifications.

### 3.1 Use-Case Reports

> Link or embed the detailed use-case specifications responsible for functional behavior.

### 3.2 Supplementary Requirements

> Include non-functional and cross-cutting requirements leveraging the Supplementary Specification for this subsystem or feature.

## 4 Supporting Information

> Provide appendices, traceability matrices, UI prototypes, or other materials that assist in applying this SRS. Clarify whether appendices are normative.

## Agent Notes

- Ensure every referenced use-case report exists and is tagged with the same identifier.
- Document assumptions and dependencies in Section 2.2 for planning alignment.
- Verify the Automation Outputs entry is satisfied before signaling completion.
- Ensure every referenced use-case report exists and shares consistent identifiers.
