# Supplementary Specification Template

## Purpose

Capture requirements that are not easily expressed in use cases, including non-functional constraints,
regulatory needs, and domain rules.

## Ownership & Collaboration

- Document Owner: System Analyst
- Contributor Roles: Requirements Reviewer, Software Architect, Test Architect
- Automation Inputs: Vision document, non-functional requirements backlog
- Automation Outputs: `supplementary-spec.md` covering sections 1â€“14


## Completion Checklist

- All quality attributes quantified where feasible
- Compliance, localization, and operational needs captured
- Traceability maintained to business objectives and risks

## Agent Notes

- Use measurable statements; avoid vague adjectives.
- Cross-reference risk list entries when a requirement mitigates a known risk.
- Coordinate with Architecture and QA to maintain consistency across artifacts.
- Verify the Automation Outputs entry is satisfied before signaling completion.
