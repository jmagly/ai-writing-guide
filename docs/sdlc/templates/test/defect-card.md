## Defect Classification

### Severity

**How critical is this defect?**

Select one:

- [ ] **Critical (P0)**: System unusable, data loss, security breach, complete feature failure
  - **Examples**: Cannot log in at all, payment processing fails 100%, data corruption, security vulnerability
  - **SLA**: Fix immediately (hotfix within hours)
  - **Impact**: Blocks all users or creates legal/security risk

- [ ] **High (P1)**: Major feature broken, significant user impact, no workaround
  - **Examples**: Search returns no results, checkout fails 50% of time, admin panel inaccessible
  - **SLA**: Fix this iteration/sprint (within days)
  - **Impact**: Blocks key workflows for many users

- [ ] **Medium (P2)**: Feature degraded, workaround exists, minor user impact
  - **Examples**: Slow page load, UI glitch, error message unclear, minor data inconsistency
  - **SLA**: Fix next iteration (within weeks)
  - **Impact**: Annoys users but doesn't block workflows

- [ ] **Low (P3)**: Cosmetic issue, minor inconvenience, edge case
  - **Examples**: Typo, alignment issue, tooltip incorrect, rare edge case
  - **SLA**: Backlog (fix when convenient)
  - **Impact**: Minimal, affects few users or rare scenarios

**Assigned Severity**: {Critical | High | Medium | Low}

**Severity Justification**: {Why this severity level? Include user impact, frequency, and business impact.}

**Example**: High - Checkout fails for 30% of users (those using Safari browser). Workaround: use Chrome. Affects revenue directly.

### Priority

**How urgently should this be fixed?**

Select one:

- [ ] **P0 (Immediate)**: Drop everything, fix now (hotfix)
- [ ] **P1 (This Iteration)**: Fix before iteration ends
- [ ] **P2 (Next Iteration)**: Fix in upcoming iteration
- [ ] **P3 (Backlog)**: Fix when capacity permits

**Assigned Priority**: {P0 | P1 | P2 | P3}

**Priority Justification**: {Why this priority? Include business context, user pain, and urgency.}

**Example**: P1 - While workaround exists (use Chrome), Safari users represent 25% of our traffic. Fix before next release to prevent revenue loss.

### Defect Type

**What category of defect is this?**

- [ ] **Functional**: Feature doesn't work as specified
- [ ] **Performance**: Unacceptable slowness or resource usage
- [ ] **Security**: Vulnerability, unauthorized access, data exposure
- [ ] **Usability**: Confusing UI, poor user experience
- [ ] **Compatibility**: Doesn't work in specific browser, OS, or device
- [ ] **Data**: Incorrect calculation, data loss, data corruption
- [ ] **Integration**: Fails to integrate with external system or service
- [ ] **Regression**: Previously working feature now broken
- [ ] **Documentation**: Incorrect or missing documentation

**Assigned Type**: {Functional | Performance | Security | etc.}

## Root Cause Analysis

**Completed after investigation, before fix**

### Root Cause

**What underlying issue caused this defect?**

Describe the technical root cause:

- Code defect (logic error, null pointer, race condition)
- Configuration error (incorrect setting, missing environment variable)
- Dependency issue (library bug, API change)
- Design flaw (architecture limitation, missing requirement)
- Data issue (corrupt data, migration error)

**Example**:

**Dependency issue**: Stripe JavaScript SDK v3.2.0 has a known bug on Safari 17 where the `confirmCardPayment()` method times out when third-party cookies are blocked (Safari's default). SDK does not gracefully handle this case and throws timeout error instead of prompting user to enable cookies or providing fallback.

### Analysis Details

**How was the root cause identified?**

- Investigation steps taken
- Tests performed
- Code reviewed
- External references (vendor bug reports, Stack Overflow, etc.)

**Example**:

1. Reproduced defect in local Safari 17 environment
2. Inspected network traffic: Stripe API request sent but no response received
3. Checked browser console: "Blocked a frame with origin from accessing a cross-origin frame" warning
4. Researched Stripe SDK issue tracker: Found reported bug #3421 matching symptoms
5. Tested with Safari third-party cookie setting enabled: Defect resolved
6. Confirmed: Safari's third-party cookie blocking causes SDK timeout

### Why-Why Analysis (5 Whys)

**Drill down to fundamental cause:**

1. **Why did checkout fail?** Stripe SDK timed out waiting for payment confirmation.
2. **Why did SDK timeout?** SDK could not access third-party cookie required for 3D Secure authentication.
3. **Why was cookie blocked?** Safari 17 blocks third-party cookies by default.
4. **Why didn't we detect this earlier?** E2E tests run in Chrome and Firefox, not Safari.
5. **Why no Safari testing?** CI pipeline lacks Safari test environment (Safari requires macOS runner).

**Fundamental Cause**: Insufficient cross-browser test coverage, specifically lack of Safari testing in CI.

### Contributing Factors

**What other factors contributed?**

- Incomplete requirements (missing browser compatibility criteria)
- Inadequate testing (no Safari in test matrix)
- Lack of monitoring (no alert when Safari checkout failures spike)
- Poor error handling (SDK timeout not handled gracefully)

## Resolution

### Fix Description

**How was the defect resolved?**

Describe the fix implementation:

- Code changes (what was modified)
- Configuration changes (what settings were updated)
- Dependency updates (libraries upgraded)
- Data repairs (records corrected)

**Example**:

**Code Change**: Updated Stripe payment integration to use Stripe Payment Element (newer SDK component) which gracefully handles third-party cookie restrictions. Added fallback to redirect-based authentication flow when cookies blocked.

**Files Changed**:

- `src/payment/StripePaymentProcessor.js` (lines 120-145)
- `src/payment/components/PaymentForm.jsx` (integrated Payment Element UI)

**Configuration**: Enabled Stripe Payment Element in Stripe Dashboard settings.

## Process Improvements

### Prevention Measures

**How can we prevent similar defects in the future?**

- Process changes (add review step, update checklist)
- Testing improvements (expand test coverage, add test environment)
- Tooling enhancements (add linter rule, enable static analysis)
- Documentation updates (add browser compatibility requirements)

**Example**:

1. **Add Safari to CI test matrix**: Provision macOS GitHub Actions runner for Safari E2E tests
2. **Update browser compatibility requirements**: Explicitly list Safari 16+ in requirements for all payment features
3. **Enable cross-browser smoke tests on every PR**: Expand TS-SHOP-001 to include Safari
4. **Monitor checkout success rate by browser**: Add Grafana dashboard with browser-specific metrics

### Lessons Learned

**What did we learn from this defect?**

**Example**:

- Safari's aggressive privacy features (third-party cookie blocking) can break common payment integrations
- Cross-browser testing must include Safari, not just Chrome-based browsers
- Stripe SDK has browser-specific quirks; consult SDK documentation for compatibility notes
- Production monitoring should segment by browser to detect browser-specific issues early
