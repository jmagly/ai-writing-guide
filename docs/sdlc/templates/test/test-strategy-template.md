# Test Strategy Template

Adapted from the original RUP template: <https://files.defcon.no/RUP/webtmpl/templates/test/rup_tststr.htm>

## Purpose

Describe the guiding principles, methodologies, and standards governing the testing effort throughout the project lifecycle.

## Ownership & Collaboration

- Document Owner: Test Architect
- Contributor Roles: Test Engineer, Configuration Manager, Project Manager
- Automation Inputs: Quality goals, architecture overview, tooling inventory
- Automation Outputs: `test-strategy.md` documenting sections 1â€“11

## Completion Checklist

- Strategy aligns with business risks, architecture, and release cadence
- Test levels, methods, and responsibilities clearly delineated
- Automation and tooling approach defined across environments

## Document Sections

1. **Context and Objectives**
   - Outline project context, risk profile, and overall testing objectives.
2. **Test Levels and Scope**
   - Define unit, integration, system, acceptance, performance, security, and usability testing scope.
3. **Test Types and Techniques**
   - Specify techniques (TDD, BDD, exploratory, model-based, etc.) and when to apply them.
4. **Automation Strategy**
   - Describe automation goals, frameworks, coverage targets, and maintenance responsibilities.
5. **Environment Strategy**
   - Detail environment provisioning, data management, and synchronization requirements.
6. **Defect Management**
   - Define defect lifecycle, severity/priority scheme, and tooling.
7. **Metrics and Reporting**
   - Identify key metrics, dashboards, and review cadence.
8. **Governance and Reviews**
   - Explain review checkpoints, quality gates, and approval workflows.
9. **Risk-Based Testing Approach**
   - Map risks to test focus areas and contingency triggers.
10. **Compliance and Standards**
    - Note industry standards or organizational policies influencing testing.
11. **Continuous Improvement**
    - Describe retrospectives, feedback loops, and learning mechanisms.

## Agent Notes

- Keep strategy evergreen; revisit when significant architectural or process changes occur.
- Align with Master Test Plan and Measurement Plan to ensure consistency.
- Include links to tooling documentation or scripts maintained elsewhere in the repo.
- Verify the Automation Outputs entry is satisfied before signaling completion.
