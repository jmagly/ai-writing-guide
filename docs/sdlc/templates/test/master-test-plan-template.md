# Master Test Plan Template

Adapted from the original RUP template: https://files.defcon.no/RUP/webtmpl/templates/test/rup_tstpln_mstr.htm

## Purpose
Establish the overarching testing strategy, scope, resources, and schedule across all phases of the project.

## Completion Checklist
- Test objectives and scope aligned with Vision and SDP
- Environments, tools, and resource needs confirmed
- Entry/exit criteria for each test level documented

## Document Sections
1. **Introduction**
   - Purpose, scope, and references to governing documents.
2. **Test Objectives**
   - Define what the testing effort aims to validate or discover.
3. **Test Items**
   - List components, features, or systems under test with version identifiers.
4. **In-Scope vs Out-of-Scope**
   - Clarify inclusions and exclusions with rationale.
5. **Test Approach**
   - Describe strategy across test levels (unit, integration, system, UAT, performance, security).
6. **Test Deliverables**
   - Enumerate artifacts (plans, cases, scripts, reports) to be produced.
7. **Test Environment**
   - Detail hardware, software, data sets, and configuration requirements.
8. **Roles and Responsibilities**
   - Assign ownership for planning, execution, automation, and reporting.
9. **Schedule and Milestones**
   - Align test activities with iteration/release milestones.
10. **Entry and Exit Criteria**
    - Define gating conditions for each test phase.
11. **Risk Management**
    - Identify testing risks, mitigation strategies, and contingency plans.
12. **Metrics and Reporting**
    - Specify KPIs (defect density, coverage, pass rate) and reporting cadence.
13. **Tools and Automation**
    - Document test management tools, automation frameworks, and integration points.
14. **Approvals**
    - Capture sign-off requirements and responsible parties.

## Agent Notes
- Keep terminology aligned with the Supplementary Specification and Risk List.
- Link to iteration-level plans and evaluation summaries for traceability.
- Update schedule and risks after each iteration assessment.
