# Development Case Template

Adapted from the original RUP template: https://files.defcon.no/RUP/webtmpl/templates/environ/wb_dvlcs.htm

## Purpose
Tailor the Rational Unified Process to the specific project, defining which artifacts, roles, and workflows are in scope for each phase and iteration.

## Completion Checklist
- Lifecycle tailoring decisions documented with rationale
- Artifact responsibilities and production schedule defined
- Review and governance checkpoints identified

## Document Sections
1. **Project Overview**
   - Summarize project context, objectives, and constraints influencing tailoring.
2. **Process Tailoring Summary**
   - Describe deviations from standard RUP, including omitted or added artifacts.
3. **Lifecycle Phases and Iterations**
   - Outline phase structure, number of iterations, and high-level objectives.
4. **Artifact Responsibility Matrix**
   - Provide table mapping artifacts to responsible roles and phase/iteration produced.

| Artifact | Responsible Role | Phase/Iteration | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Example | Role name | Inception Iteration 1 | Tailoring comments |

5. **Role Tailoring**
   - List roles engaged, merged, or delegated to automated agents.
6. **Workflow and Activity Adjustments**
   - Explain changes to workflows (e.g., additional reviews, automation).
7. **Tooling and Environment Setup**
   - Document tools, repositories, and automation supporting the tailored process.
8. **Compliance and Governance**
   - Note required reviews, approvals, or audits.
9. **Change Management**
   - Describe how tailoring decisions may evolve over time and how changes are approved.
10. **Appendices**
    - Include detailed schedules, checklists, or decision logs.

## Agent Notes
- Keep development case current; review at phase transitions.
- Coordinate with Software Development Plan and Configuration Management Plan.
- Store tailoring decisions to help new agents onboard quickly.
