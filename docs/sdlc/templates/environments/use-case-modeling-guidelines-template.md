## Agent Notes

- Include naming conventions so generated use-case files follow consistent identifiers.
- Call out review checkpoints agents must satisfy before accepting a use-case spec.
- Verify the Automation Outputs entry is satisfied before signaling completion.
- Define naming conventions so automation generates consistent identifiers.
- List acceptance checks that must pass before approving a use-case spec.
