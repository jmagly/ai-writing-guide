# Measurement Plan Template


## Purpose
Define the metrics, collection methods, and reporting cadence used to monitor project health and product quality.

## Completion Checklist
- Metrics mapped to project objectives and risks
- Data collection methods and tools specified
- Reporting cadence and stakeholders defined

## Document Sections
1. **Measurement Objectives**
   - State why measurement is necessary and which decisions it supports.
2. **Metric Inventory**
   - List metrics with definitions, formulas, and targets.

| Metric | Purpose | Data Source | Frequency | Target/Threshold | Owner |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Example Metric | Explain why it matters. | Tool or artifact. | Weekly | Target value. | Person/role. |

3. **Data Collection Process**
   - Describe how data is gathered, validated, and stored.
4. **Reporting and Visualization**
   - Identify dashboards, reports, and distribution lists.
5. **Roles and Responsibilities**
   - Define who collects, analyzes, and acts on metrics.
6. **Review Cadence**
   - Specify when metrics are reviewed (stand-ups, demos, governance boards).
7. **Continuous Improvement**
   - Outline how metrics will be refined or retired.
8. **Risks and Assumptions**
   - Capture measurement risks (data quality, tooling limits) and mitigation plans.

## Agent Notes
- Ensure metric definitions align with Status Assessments and Test Strategy.
- Automate data collection whenever possible; link scripts or queries used.
- Revisit metrics when project goals or risks evolve.
