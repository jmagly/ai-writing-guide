## Dependencies

### Upstream Dependencies

Work that must complete before this epic can progress:

| Dependency ID | Description | Owner | Status | Impact if Delayed |
|---------------|-------------|-------|--------|-------------------|
| DEP-012 | Database schema migration | Data Team | Complete | Epic blocked entirely |
| DEP-013 | Design system update | Design Team | In Progress | UX consistency issues |

### Downstream Impact

Work that depends on this epic:

| Dependent Epic/Feature | Impact if This Epic Delayed |
|------------------------|----------------------------|
| EP-PLATFORM-007 (AI Recommendations) | Cannot personalize without search data |
| FEAT-088 (Mobile App Search) | Cannot launch mobile until web proven |

### External Dependencies

Third-party or cross-team dependencies:

| External System/Team | Dependency | Risk | Mitigation |
|----------------------|------------|------|------------|
| Location API Vendor | Geocoding service | Medium - vendor outage | Cache frequently used locations |
| Legal/Compliance | Privacy review of search data | Low - may delay analytics | Start review early, parallel path |

## Risks and Assumptions

### Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation | Contingency |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|-------------|
| Search performance degrades at scale | Medium | High | Load testing, caching strategy | Degrade gracefully, queue searches |
| User adoption lower than expected | Low | High | Beta testing, user research | Invest in onboarding, simplify UI |
| Database migration fails | Low | Critical | Rollback plan, phased migration | Extend timeline, reduce scope |

### Assumptions

| Assumption | Impact if Invalid | Validation Approach |
|------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Users want advanced filters (not just keyword) | High - wasted effort | User research, surveys |
| Current database can handle search load | High - requires re-architecture | Load testing in staging |
| Legal approves storing search history | Medium - delays saved searches | Early legal review |
