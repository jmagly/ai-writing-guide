# Delivery Track Flow

## Objective

Implement prioritized slices with tests and quality gates.

## Loop

1. Plan task slices (task cards) with test-first strategy
2. Implement code and tests; keep commits traceable
3. Run suites, fix defects, update iteration assessment
4. Validate gates (security, reliability)
5. Integrate and prepare release notes/runbooks


## Exit Criteria per slice

- Tests green and coverage targets met
- Gates passed; defects triaged
- Traceability updated and iteration assessment recorded
