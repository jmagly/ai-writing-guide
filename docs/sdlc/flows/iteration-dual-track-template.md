# Dual-Track Iteration Flow

## Objective

Synchronize discovery (next) and delivery (current) to maximize throughput.

## Cadence

- Day 1: Kickoff current delivery; plan discovery for next iteration
- Midpoint: Delivery checkpoint; discovery ADR decisions
- End: Delivery gates; discovery handoff checklist → backlog ready

## Handoffs

- Discovery → Delivery: handoff checklist with briefs, acceptance, data contracts, risks, ADRs
- Delivery → Ops: ORR checklist, runbooks, release notes

## Metrics

- Ready backlog size (next iteration)
- Gate pass rate and defect leakage
- Risk retirement velocity
