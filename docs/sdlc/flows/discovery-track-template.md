3. Draft data contracts and interface cards
4. Spike/POC for high-risk assumptions
5. Update ADRs for decisions
6. Hand off to delivery with handoff checklist

## Exit Criteria per item

- Brief + acceptance + data contract complete
- Risks addressed or scheduled
- Traceability seeded (req → design → tests)
