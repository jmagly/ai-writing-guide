# Concept → Inception Flow

## Objective

Validate the problem, scope, risks, and success metrics before implementation.

## Steps

1. Idea intake (vision brief, stakeholders, constraints)
2. Business value and persona alignment (use-case briefs)
3. Top risks identified (spikes/POCs planned)
4. Security and privacy screening (data classes, threat scan)
5. Architecture sketch (component boundaries, interfaces)
6. Decision checkpoints (ADR for critical choices)
7. Funding and scope guardrails

## Exit Criteria

- Vision brief approved; success metrics defined
- 1–3 risks retired or planned with owners/dates
- Initial architecture and data classifications recorded
- Go/No-Go decision to Elaboration
