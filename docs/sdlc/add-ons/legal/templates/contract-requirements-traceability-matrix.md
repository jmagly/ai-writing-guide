## 1 Introduction

> Establish bidirectional traceability between contractual obligations and system requirements to ensure all commitments are implemented and verified.

### 1.1 Purpose

This matrix maps contract clauses to requirements, design decisions, implementation artifacts, and verification methods, providing audit evidence that all contractual commitments are fulfilled.

### 1.2 Scope

This document covers:
- Customer contract obligations (SLAs, features, milestones, compliance)
- Vendor contract dependencies (SLAs, services, compliance)
- Traceability from contract → requirement → design → implementation → test → verification
- Gap identification (contractual obligations without implementation)
- Compliance verification (evidence that obligations are met)

### 1.3 Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations

- **Traceability**: Linkage between contract clause, requirement, design, implementation, and verification
- **Contract Obligation**: Commitment in contract (SLA, deliverable, compliance certification)
- **Requirement ID**: Unique identifier for system requirement (SR-, FR-, NFR- prefix)
- **Verification Method**: How obligation fulfillment is verified (test, audit, monitoring)
- **Gap**: Contract obligation without corresponding requirement or implementation

### 1.5 Overview

Section 2 establishes traceability framework; Section 3 maps customer contract obligations; Section 4 maps vendor contract dependencies; Section 5 provides traceability verification; Section 6 identifies gaps.

## 2 Traceability Framework

> Define traceability structure, ID conventions, and relationship types.

### 2.1 Traceability Levels

**Five-Level Traceability Chain**:

1. **Contract Clause** → Specific section of contract (customer SOW, vendor MSA)
2. **System Requirement** → Derived requirement (SR-xxx, FR-xxx, NFR-xxx)
3. **Design Decision** → Architecture choice, component design
4. **Implementation Artifact** → Code module, configuration, infrastructure
5. **Verification Method** → Test case, monitoring metric, audit procedure

**Bidirectional Traceability**:
- **Forward**: Contract clause → Requirement → Design → Implementation → Verification
- **Backward**: Verification → Implementation → Design → Requirement → Contract clause

### 2.2 ID Prefix Conventions

| Prefix | Entity Type | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **CONT-** | Contract ID | CONT-2024-001 (Acme Corp SOW) |
| **CL-** | Contract Clause | CL-CONT-2024-001-3.2 (SOW Section 3.2) |
| **SR-** | Stakeholder Requirement | SR-001 (High-level business need) |
| **FR-** | Functional Requirement | FR-012 (Specific feature) |
| **NFR-** | Non-Functional Requirement | NFR-005 (Performance, security, compliance) |

**Action**: Review Datadog SOC 2 report quarterly, alert Legal Liaison 90 days before expiration

## 5 Traceability Verification

> Verify traceability completeness and accuracy.

### 5.1 Forward Traceability Verification

**Purpose**: Ensure all contract obligations have corresponding requirements, implementation, and verification

**Process**:
1. **Extract contract obligations**: Parse all customer and vendor contracts
2. **Map to requirements**: Identify system requirements addressing each obligation
3. **Identify gaps**: Obligations without requirements = gap
4. **Map to implementation**: Verify requirements are implemented
5. **Map to verification**: Verify implementation is tested/monitored

**Verification Report**:

| Contract ID | Total Obligations | Traced to Requirements | Traced to Implementation | Traced to Verification | Gaps |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CONT-2024-001 (Acme Corp) | 25 | 25 (100%) | 23 (92%) | 23 (92%) | 2 (NFR-050, NFR-061 not implemented) |
| VEND-2023-001 (AWS) | 5 | 5 (100%) | 5 (100%) | 5 (100%) | 0 |

**Gap Analysis**: 2 obligations not fully implemented (multi-region architecture, secondary monitoring vendor) → Create work items

### 5.2 Backward Traceability Verification

**Purpose**: Ensure all requirements, designs, and implementations trace back to contract obligations (avoid gold-plating, out-of-scope work)

**Process**:
1. **List all requirements**: From supplementary spec, SRS, architecture docs
2. **Trace to contract**: Identify which contract clause drives each requirement
3. **Identify orphans**: Requirements without contract traceability = potential scope creep
4. **Validate necessity**: Are orphan requirements needed? (technical necessity, regulatory requirement, etc.)

**Orphan Report**:

| Requirement ID | Description | Contract Traceability | Justification |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| NFR-100 | Implement GraphQL API | None (not in contract) | Technical preference, not contractually required → Review with Product Manager |
| NFR-101 | Support dark mode UI | None (not in contract) | User experience enhancement → Defer to future release |

**Action**: Review orphan requirements, prioritize contract-driven work first

### 5.3 Automated Traceability Checks

**Tools**:
- **Metadata extraction**: Parse contract PDFs, extract clauses, obligations
- **Requirements database**: Store requirements with contract links in [tool]
- **Traceability graph**: Visualize contract → requirement → implementation → verification links
- **Gap detection**: Automated reports of missing traceability links

**CI/CD Integration**: Block phase gate transitions if traceability gaps exceed threshold (e.g., > 5% obligations untraced)

**Traceability Dashboard**: Real-time view of traceability completeness, gaps, status

## 6 Gap Identification and Resolution

> Identify and address gaps in traceability.

### 6.1 Gap Types

| Gap Type | Description | Impact | Resolution |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Contract obligation without requirement** | Contractual commitment not captured in requirements | Contract breach risk, missing functionality | Create requirement, assign owner, prioritize |
| **Requirement without implementation** | Requirement specified but not built | Contract breach risk, incomplete delivery | Create work item, assign to development team |
| **Implementation without verification** | Feature built but not tested | Quality risk, cannot prove compliance | Create test case, execute, document results |
| **Contract obligation without verification** | No evidence of compliance | Audit failure, customer dispute | Define verification method, collect evidence |

### 6.2 Gap Resolution Process

**Step 1: Identify Gaps**
- Run traceability verification (Section 5.1)
- Generate gap report (obligations without full traceability chain)

**Step 2: Prioritize Gaps**
- **P0 (Critical)**: Contract breach imminent (deadline < 30 days, customer escalation)
- **P1 (High)**: Contract breach likely (deadline < 90 days, high financial impact)
- **P2 (Medium)**: Contract risk (deadline > 90 days, moderate financial impact)
- **P3 (Low)**: Minor gaps (informational requirements, low impact)

**Step 3: Assign Owners**
- Gap owner: Stakeholder responsible for closing gap
- Due date: Based on contract deadline and priority
- Status: Open / In Progress / Closed

**Step 4: Close Gaps**
- Create missing requirement, implementation, or verification
- Update traceability matrix
- Verify gap closed (full traceability chain complete)

**Step 5: Prevent Recurrence**
- Root cause analysis: Why was gap missed?
- Process improvement: Update intake process, requirements process, review checklists

### 6.3 Gap Tracking

**Gap Register**:

| Gap ID | Contract Clause | Gap Type | Description | Priority | Owner | Due Date | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GAP-001 | CL-CONT-2024-001-4.1 | Requirement without implementation | Multi-region failover not implemented | P1 | Engineering Lead | 2025-06-01 | Open |
| GAP-002 | CL-CONT-2024-001-2.1 | Implementation without verification | Feature X not yet UAT tested | P1 | QA Lead | 2025-11-15 | In Progress |
| GAP-003 | CL-VEND-2024-003-2.1 | Contract obligation without verification | Secondary monitoring vendor not identified | P2 | DevOps Lead | 2025-12-31 | Open |

**Gap Review Frequency**: Weekly (for P0/P1 gaps), Monthly (for P2/P3 gaps)

**Gap Escalation**: If gap not closed by due date, escalate to Project Manager and Legal Liaison

## Agent Notes

- Prioritize traceability for high-risk contracts (large customers, high revenue, regulatory requirements)
- Automate traceability where possible (metadata extraction, CI/CD gap detection)
- Use traceability to prevent scope creep (orphan requirements without contract basis)
- Verify traceability completeness at phase gates (Elaboration: requirements traced, Transition: verification traced)
- Gap identification early (Inception, Elaboration) prevents last-minute scramble before deadlines
- Link traceability to contract compliance dashboard (real-time SLA monitoring)
- Document verification evidence (test results, audit reports, monitoring screenshots) for contract audits
- Coordinate with Legal Liaison on contract interpretation (what obligations require traceability)
- Verify Automation Outputs entry is satisfied before signaling completion
