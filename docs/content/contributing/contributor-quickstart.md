## Overview

Contributing to the AI Writing Guide (AIWG) is different from typical open source projects. You'll use AIWG's own Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) framework to develop your feature—using AIWG to build AIWG (dogfooding). This feedback loop improves both your contribution and the framework itself.

**What makes this unique:**

- Work directly in your AIWG installation (`~/.local/share/ai-writing-guide`)
- Use AIWG's SDLC agents and commands to build your feature
- Automated quality validation ensures maintainability
- Recovery is simple: `aiwg -reinstall` provides a fresh installation
- Commands work with any GitHub repository, not just AIWG

**Time to first pull request (PR):** ~30 minutes (for simple integrations like single-file changes)

**Quality requirements:** Minimum 80/100 quality score (see [Quality Standards](#quality-standards))

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

### Required Tools

- **GitHub CLI (`gh`)** - Version 2.0 or higher

  ```bash
  # Install
  brew install gh                    # macOS
  sudo apt install gh                # Ubuntu/Debian
  winget install GitHub.cli          # Windows

  # Authenticate
  gh auth login
  ```

- **Node.js** - Version 18.20.8 or higher

  ```bash
  # Check version
  node --version
  # Should output: v18.20.8 or higher
  ```

- **Git** - Version 2.0 or higher

  ```bash
  # Check version
  git --version

  # Configure if needed
  git config --global user.name "Your Name"
  git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
  ```

### Recommended Tools

- **Claude Code** or **Warp** - For natural language SDLC workflow orchestration (recommended but optional)
  - Claude Code: https://claude.ai/code
  - Warp: https://warp.dev

- **VS Code** or **Cursor** - For code editing
  - VS Code: https://code.visualstudio.com
  - Cursor: https://cursor.com

### Verify Prerequisites

```bash
# Check all required tools
gh --version         # Should output: gh version 2.x.x
node --version       # Should output: v18.20.8+
git --version        # Should output: git version 2.x.x

# Verify GitHub authentication
gh auth status
# Should output: Logged in to github.com as <username>
```

> **Important:** All commands must complete successfully (exit code 0) before proceeding. If any fail, install the missing tool and try again.

### ✓ Prerequisites Complete

When all checks pass:
- ✓ gh version 2.x.x detected
- ✓ node version 18.20.8+ detected
- ✓ git version 2.x.x detected
- ✓ GitHub authentication active

Time to contribute: ~30 minutes remaining
**[Continue to Quick Start Workflow →](#quick-start-workflow)**

## Quick Start Workflow

### Quality Standards Overview

Before diving into the workflow, understand AIWG's quality expectations:

- **Minimum quality score:** 80/100 (calculated automatically)
- **Required documentation:** README update, quick-start guide
- **Linting:** All markdown must pass `markdownlint-cli2`
- **Manifests:** All `manifest.json` files synced

See [Quality Standards](#quality-standards) for complete details.

### Your Contribution Journey

[●○○○○○○○] Step 1 of 8: Fork and Initialize

### Step 1: Fork and Initialize (⏱ 5 minutes)

Start a new contribution with a single command. This will fork the repository, create your feature branch, and set up your workspace.

```bash
aiwg -contribute-start cursor-integration
```

**What this does:**

1. Forks `jmagly/ai-writing-guide` to your GitHub account
2. Clones your fork to `~/.local/share/ai-writing-guide`
3. Adds remotes: `origin` (your fork), `upstream` (main repo)
4. Creates feature branch: `contrib/<username>/cursor-integration`
5. Deploys SDLC agents/commands to your fork
6. Creates workspace: `.aiwg/contrib/cursor-integration/`
7. Generates intake form for your feature

**Expected output:**

```text
Starting contribution workflow...
✓ Forked jmagly/ai-writing-guide → yourname/ai-writing-guide
✓ Added remotes (origin=fork, upstream=main)
✓ Created branch: contrib/yourname/cursor-integration
✓ Deployed SDLC agents to fork
✓ Created workspace: .aiwg/contrib/cursor-integration/

Next steps:
1. Open in Claude Code: claude ~/.local/share/ai-writing-guide
2. Complete intake: "Complete intake for cursor-integration feature"
3. Start development: "Start Inception phase for cursor-integration"
```

**If this fails:**
- "gh not authenticated" → Run `gh auth login`, then retry
- "Fork already exists" → Continue anyway (will use existing fork)
- Other error → [See full troubleshooting](#troubleshooting)

> **Note:** If you already have a fork (your personal copy of the repository on GitHub), the command will detect it and add it as `origin` instead of creating a new fork.

### ✓ Step 1 Complete: Fork Initialized

Great start! You've successfully set up your contribution environment.

**What you've accomplished:**
- Created your own fork
- Set up development workspace
- Ready for feature development

**Next milestone:** Complete intake (10 minutes)
[●●○○○○○○] Step 2 of 8: Complete Intake

### Step 2: Complete Intake (⏱ 10 minutes)

**Choose your editor:**

- **Claude Code** (recommended): Natural language SDLC orchestration
  ```bash
  claude ~/.local/share/ai-writing-guide
  ```

- **Warp**: Terminal with AI features
  ```bash
  cd ~/.local/share/ai-writing-guide
  warp
  ```

> **Note:** You can use natural language with Claude Code or Warp (e.g., "Complete intake for cursor-integration") or explicit commands (e.g., `/intake-wizard`). This guide shows natural language for readability.

**Natural language prompt to Claude Code or Warp:**

```text
Complete intake for cursor-integration feature.

Feature description: Add native Cursor Editor support with single-file .cursor/rules integration. This includes:
- Setup command: aiwg -setup-cursor
- Agent deployment to .cursor/rules
- Quick-start documentation

Priority: Medium
Complexity: Low
Timeline: 1 week
```

**The intake wizard will:**
- Generate `.aiwg/contrib/cursor-integration/intake.md`
- Ask strategic questions about your feature
- Create initial implementation plan

### Intake Quality Checklist

Before moving to development, verify your intake includes:
- [ ] Clear feature description (2-3 sentences)
- [ ] Specific deliverables (commands, files, docs)
- [ ] Success criteria (how you'll know it works)
- [ ] Estimated timeline (1 week, 2 weeks, etc.)

Missing any? Claude Code or Warp will prompt you to fill gaps.
Estimated time: 5-10 minutes

**Example intake output:**

```markdown
# Feature Intake: Cursor Integration

## Feature Overview
- **Feature ID:** cursor-integration
- **Priority:** Medium
- **Complexity:** Low
- **Timeline:** 1 week

## Description
Add native Cursor Editor support with single-file .cursor/rules integration.

## Deliverables
- Setup command: aiwg -setup-cursor
- Agent deployment script

```

### ✓ Intake Complete

Your feature intake includes:
- ✓ Clear description
- ✓ Specific deliverables
- ✓ Success criteria
- ✓ Timeline estimate

Quality: Strong foundation for development
[●●●○○○○○] Step 3 of 8: Development

### Step 3: Develop Your Feature (⏱ 45-60 minutes)

### Development Phase Progress

Typical timeline for low-complexity features:
1. **Inception** (architecture sketch, risks) → 10-15 min
2. **Construction** (implementation, tests, docs) → 45-60 min
3. Ready for validation → Total: ~1 hour

You'll know you're progressing when you see:
- ✓ markers for completed steps
- New files appearing in `.aiwg/contrib/<feature>/`
- "Next:" prompts from Claude Code or Warp

**Natural language prompt to Claude Code or Warp:**

```text
Start Inception phase for cursor-integration.

Guidance: Focus on simplicity. Follow the pattern from warp integration (tools/warp/setup-warp.mjs). Priority is single-command deployment.
```

**What happens:**
- Claude Code or Warp orchestrates SDLC workflows
- Creates architecture sketch
- Identifies risks
- Generates implementation plan
- Starts Construction phase

**Example development session:**

```text
You: "Implement cursor integration setup command"

Claude: I'll create the setup command following the Warp integration pattern.
        Creating: tools/cursor/setup-cursor.mjs
        ✓ Setup command implemented (250 lines)
        ✓ Unit tests created
        Next: Update install.sh routing

You: "Update install.sh to route --setup-cursor"

Claude: Adding cursor routing to install.sh...
        ✓ Added --setup-cursor case
        ✓ Follows existing pattern
        Next: Create documentation

You: "Create quick-start documentation"

Claude: Creating docs/integrations/cursor-quickstart.md...
        ✓ Quick-start guide created
        ✓ Prerequisites listed
        ✓ Example walkthrough included
        Next: Run quality validation
```

> **Pro Tip:** Use natural language throughout. Claude Code or Warp understands AIWG's SDLC terminology and will orchestrate the right workflows automatically.

[●●●●○○○○] Step 4 of 8: Validate Quality

### Step 4: Validate Quality (⏱ 2-5 minutes)

Before creating a PR, validate your contribution meets quality standards:

```bash
aiwg -contribute-test cursor-integration
```

### Understanding Your Quality Score

**80/100 threshold:** Ensures your contribution is maintainable and consistent

**Score breakdown:**
- 100-90%: Excellent, ready for PR
- 89-80%: Good, minor fixes needed
- 79-70%: Needs attention, follow fix suggestions
- <70%: Significant gaps, review requirements

**Common first-timer issues:**
- Forgot to update README.md (-20 points)
- Markdown formatting errors (-5 each)
- Manifests out of sync (-10 points)

Validation takes ~30 seconds. Re-run as often as needed.

**What this checks:**

1. **Markdown Lint:** All `.md` files follow formatting rules (quality score component)
2. **Manifest Sync:** Manifest files are up-to-date
3. **Documentation:** README, quick-start, integration docs present
4. **Breaking Changes:** Documented if present
5. **Quality Score:** Calculated based on completeness

**Expected output (passing):**

```text
Running quality validation for cursor-integration...

✓ Markdown lint: PASSED (0 errors, 0 warnings)
✓ Manifest sync: PASSED (all manifests current)
✓ Documentation: COMPLETE
  - README.md updated ✓
  - Quick-start guide present ✓
  - Integration doc present ✓
✓ Breaking changes: NONE
✓ Tool validation: PASSED

Quality Score: 95/100

✅ Ready for PR creation
```

**Expected output (failing):**

```text

⚠ Manifest sync: NEEDS UPDATE (run: aiwg -sync-manifests)
✗ Documentation: INCOMPLETE
  - README.md not updated ✗
  - Quick-start guide present ✓
  - Integration doc present ✓
✓ Breaking changes: NONE
✓ Tool validation: PASSED

Quality Score: 72/100

❌ Quality score below minimum (80). Fix issues before PR creation.

Issues to fix:
1. Update README.md to mention cursor integration
2. Run manifest sync: aiwg -sync-manifests --write

Fix command: aiwg -contribute-test cursor-integration --verbose
```

**If validation fails:**
- "Manifest out of sync" → Run `aiwg -sync-manifests --write`, then retry
- "Documentation incomplete" → Update missing docs, then retry
- "Quality score <80" → Fix listed issues, then retry

> **Important:** Minimum quality score is 80/100. If your score is below this, fix the issues listed and re-run validation. See [Quality Standards](#quality-standards) for scoring details.

### Responding to Feedback: Communication Tips

**Reviewers want to help.** Feedback is about code quality, not you.

**If you agree with feedback:**
- Use Option 2 (AIWG agent) for straightforward changes
- Use Option 1 (editor) if you want to learn the fix
- Say thanks: "Great catch, fixed in latest commit"

**If you need clarification:**
- Use Option 4 to ask questions
- Template: "Could you clarify X? I interpreted it as Y."

**If you disagree (respectfully):**
- Explain your reasoning with examples
- Template: "I considered X, but chose Y because [reason]. What do you think?"

**Typical review cycles:** 1-2 rounds for simple features, 2-4 for complex ones.

[●●●●●●●○] Step 7 of 8: Keep Your Fork Synced

## Syncing Your Fork

### Sync with Upstream

Regularly sync your fork with the main repository:

```bash
aiwg -contribute-sync cursor-integration
```

**Expected output (no conflicts):**

```text
Checking for upstream changes...
Upstream changes detected:
- 5 new commits on main
- No conflicts detected

Sync strategy:
[1] Rebase (recommended - clean history)
[2] Merge (preserves all commits)

Choice: 1

Rebasing contrib/yourname/cursor-integration onto upstream/main...
✓ Rebased successfully
✓ Pushed to origin (force-with-lease)

Your branch is now up-to-date with upstream/main
```

**Expected output (with conflicts):**

```text
Checking for upstream changes...
Upstream changes detected:
- 5 new commits on main
- Potential conflicts in: install.sh

Sync strategy:
[1] Rebase (recommended)
[2] Merge

Choice: 1

Rebasing...
❌ Conflict detected in install.sh (line 245)

Conflict preview:
<<<<<<< HEAD (your changes)
  --setup-cursor)
    node "$INSTALL_DIR/tools/cursor/setup-cursor.mjs" "${@:2}"

  --setup-windsurf)
    node "$INSTALL_DIR/tools/windsurf/setup-windsurf.mjs" "${@:2}"
>>>>>>> upstream/main (incoming changes)

Options:
[1] Open in editor to resolve manually
[2] Use AIWG agent to resolve conflict
[3] Accept your version
[4] Accept upstream version
[5] Abort rebase

Choice: 2

Launching Conflict Resolver agent...
Analyzing conflict...
✓ Conflict resolved: Kept both cursor and windsurf cases
✓ Validated syntax

Continuing rebase...
✓ Rebase complete
✓ Pushed to origin (force-with-lease)

Your branch is now up-to-date with upstream/main
```

**If conflicts occur:**
- "Use AIWG agent" → Automated resolution
- "Open in editor" → Manual resolution
- "Abort rebase" → Start over

> **Important:** Run sync before creating PRs and weekly during long-running contributions.

## Abort and Recovery

### Abort Current Contribution

If you need to abandon a contribution or start fresh:

```bash
aiwg -contribute-abort cursor-integration
```

**What this does:**

1. Switches to main branch
2. Deletes feature branch locally and remotely
3. Removes `.aiwg/contrib/cursor-integration/` workspace
4. Optionally deletes fork (asks for confirmation)

**Expected output:**

```text
Aborting contribution: cursor-integration

⚠ Warning: This will delete:
- Local branch: contrib/yourname/cursor-integration
- Remote branch: origin/contrib/yourname/cursor-integration
- Workspace: .aiwg/contrib/cursor-integration/

Your fork (yourname/ai-writing-guide) will be preserved.

Continue? [y/n]: y

✓ Switched to main branch
✓ Deleted local branch: contrib/yourname/cursor-integration
✓ Deleted remote branch: origin/contrib/yourname/cursor-integration
✓ Removed workspace: .aiwg/contrib/cursor-integration/

Contribution aborted. Your fork is still available at:
https://github.com/yourname/ai-writing-guide

To start a new contribution:
aiwg -contribute-start <feature-name>
```

### Fresh Start (Reinstall AIWG)

If your AIWG installation is corrupted or you want a completely clean slate:

```bash
aiwg -reinstall
```

**What this does:**

1. Backs up custom configuration (if any)
2. Deletes `~/.local/share/ai-writing-guide`
3. Clones fresh copy from upstream
4. Restores configuration
5. Re-registers `aiwg` CLI

**Expected output:**

```text
⚠ Warning: This will delete your entire AIWG installation.

Your fork and remote branches will be preserved.
Custom configuration will be backed up.

Continue? [y/n]: y

Creating backup...
✓ Backed up: ~/.local/share/ai-writing-guide.backup/

Removing installation...
✓ Deleted: ~/.local/share/ai-writing-guide

Cloning fresh copy...
✓ Cloned: jmagly/ai-writing-guide → ~/.local/share/ai-writing-guide

Restoring configuration...
✓ Restored: .aiwg/config.json

Re-registering CLI...
✓ aiwg command registered

✅ Fresh installation complete

To resume your contribution:
1. aiwg -contribute-start cursor-integration
   (will detect existing fork and branch)
2. Continue where you left off
```

> **Note:** `aiwg -reinstall` is safe to run anytime. Your fork and remote branches are never deleted.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Issue: GitHub CLI not authenticated

**Error:**

```text
Error: gh not authenticated
Run: gh auth login
```

**Fix:**

```bash
gh auth login
# Follow interactive prompts
```

#### Issue: Fork already exists

**Error:**

```text
Error: Fork already exists at yourname/ai-writing-guide
```

**Fix:**

```bash
# Check existing contributions
aiwg -contribute-status

# Or start contribution anyway (will use existing fork)
aiwg -contribute-start <feature-name>
```

#### Issue: Quality score too low

**Error:**

```text
Error: Quality score too low (65/100)

Issues:
- Markdown lint: 3 errors
- Documentation: README.md not updated
```

**Fix:**

```bash
# View detailed issues
aiwg -contribute-test <feature-name> --verbose

# Fix markdown lint errors
npm exec markdownlint-cli2-fix "**/*.md"

# Update README
# (open in editor and add feature mention)

# Re-run validation
aiwg -contribute-test <feature-name>
```

#### Issue: Merge conflict

**Error:**

```text
Error: Merge conflict in install.sh

Options:
1. Open in editor
2. Use AIWG agent
3. Abort
```

**Fix (Option 1 - Manual):**

```bash
# Open conflicted file
code install.sh

# Resolve conflict markers (<<<<<<, =======, >>>>>>>)
# Save file

# Continue rebase
git rebase --continue

# Push
git push origin <branch> --force-with-lease
```

**Fix (Option 2 - Agent):**

```bash
# In aiwg -contribute-sync session:
Choice: 2  # Use AIWG agent to resolve conflict

# Agent analyzes and resolves automatically
```

#### Issue: PR creation fails

**Error:**

```text
Error: Cannot create PR. Uncommitted changes detected.

Uncommitted files:
- tools/cursor/setup-cursor.mjs
- docs/integrations/cursor-quickstart.md
```

**Fix:**

```bash
# Commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "Complete cursor integration implementation"

# Try PR creation again
aiwg -contribute-pr <feature-name>
```

#### Issue: Outdated fork

**Error:**

```text
Error: Your branch is 15 commits behind upstream/main

Run: aiwg -contribute-sync <feature-name>
```

**Fix:**

```bash
aiwg -contribute-sync <feature-name>
# Choose: [1] Rebase (recommended)
```

#### Issue: Network timeout or connection failure

**Error:**

```text
Error: Failed to fetch upstream changes
Network timeout after 30s
```

**Fix:**

```bash
# Retry command
aiwg -contribute-sync cursor-integration

# Or check network

```

#### Issue: GitHub API rate limit exceeded

**Error:**

```text
Error: API rate limit exceeded

## FAQ

### Q: Can I work on multiple features simultaneously?

**A:** Yes. Use separate feature branches and workspaces:

```bash
aiwg -contribute-start cursor-integration
aiwg -contribute-start windsurf-integration
aiwg -contribute-start new-agent-feature
```

Each gets isolated workspace in `.aiwg/contrib/<feature>/`.

### Q: What if my quality score is 79%?

**A:** You need 80% minimum. Fix the issues listed by `aiwg -contribute-test --verbose` and re-run validation.

### Q: Can I use my own editor instead of Claude Code or Warp?

**A:** Yes. SDLC workflows are helpful but not required. You can:

```bash
# Use any editor
code ~/.local/share/ai-writing-guide

# Create PR manually
git commit -am "Add feature"
git push origin <branch>
gh pr create --title "..." --body "..."
```

But you'll need to ensure quality manually.

### Q: How long until my PR is reviewed?

**A:** Typically 1-3 days. Complex PRs may take longer. Monitor status:

```bash
aiwg -contribute-monitor <feature>
```

### Q: What if I disagree with requested changes?

**A:** Discuss in PR comments:

```bash
gh pr comment <pr-number> --body "I implemented X instead of Y because..."
```

Maintainers are open to alternative approaches if well-reasoned.

### Q: Can I contribute to other repos using these commands?

**A:** Yes! The contributor commands work with any GitHub repository:

```bash
# Fork and contribute to any repo
cd <some-repo>
aiwg -contribute-start <feature>
# ... same workflow
```

### Q: What happens if upstream changes conflict with my PR?

**A:** Sync your fork:

```bash
aiwg -contribute-sync <feature>
# Resolve conflicts
# Push updated branch
```

PR will automatically update.

### Q: Do I need AIWG installed to contribute?

**A:** Yes. The contributor workflow uses AIWG's installation directory and tooling. Install first:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jmagly/ai-writing-guide/main/tools/install/install.sh | bash
```
