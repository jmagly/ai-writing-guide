# Research References

This directory contains references to academic papers, industry research, and foundational works that inform AIWG's design and evolution.

## Purpose

- Document research that validates or extends AIWG concepts
- Track academic foundations for multi-agent orchestration patterns
- Identify opportunities for iterative self-improvement based on published research
- Provide citations for AIWG's theoretical underpinnings

## Reference Format

Each reference document includes:

- **Citation**: Full academic citation
- **Summary**: Key concepts and contributions
- **AIWG Alignment**: Where AIWG already embodies the research
- **Improvement Opportunities**: Where AIWG could adapt or extend concepts
- **Implementation Notes**: Actionable items for AIWG enhancement
