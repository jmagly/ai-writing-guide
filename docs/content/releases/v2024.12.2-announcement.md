# v2024.12.2 - Skill Seekers Integration

**Released**: December 10, 2025

This release adds **Skill Seekers community integration** with two new addons, **workspace health guidance** for transition points, and **standardized command usability** across all flow commands.

## Highlights

| What Changed | Why You Care |
|--------------|--------------|
| doc-intelligence addon | Intelligent documentation analysis |
| skill-factory addon | Generate skills from natural language |
| Workspace health skill | Know when your workspace needs cleanup |
| --interactive and --guidance flags | Consistent command parameters everywhere |
| Multi-provider skill deployment | Skills deploy to Factory AI too |

## New Addons

### doc-intelligence

Intelligent documentation analysis and generation:

- Cross-repository knowledge synthesis
- Documentation gap detection and remediation
- Integrates with Skill Seekers community marketplace

```bash
aiwg use all  # Includes doc-intelligence
```

### skill-factory

Automated skill generation from natural language:

- Skill template scaffolding and validation
- Multi-platform skill deployment (Claude, Factory, OpenAI)
- Community skill discovery and curation workflows

## Workspace Health Skill

Natural language triggers for workspace assessment:

```text
"check workspace health"
"workspace status"
"is my workspace aligned"
```

Assesses:
- `.aiwg/working/` directory health (stale files, large artifacts)
- Documentation alignment with codebase
- Artifact freshness and completeness

Provides actionable recommendations without auto-executing. Use at phase transitions and after intensive processes.

## Command Usability

Added `--interactive` and `--guidance` parameters to 28 commands:

```bash
# Interactive mode with strategic questions
/flow-inception-to-elaboration --interactive

# Guidance to influence execution
/flow-security-review-cycle --guidance "Focus on authentication and HIPAA"

# Combined
/intake-wizard "Build customer portal" --interactive --guidance "B2B SaaS, HIPAA compliance"
```

### Commands Updated

- All intake commands (intake-wizard, intake-start, intake-from-codebase)
- All flow commands (phase transitions, reviews, deployments)
- Marketing commands (campaign-kickoff, creative-brief)
- Gate and validation commands

## Post-Completion Guidance

Added "Post-Completion" section to 9 major flow commands recommending:
- Workspace health check after workflow completion
- Follow-up actions based on workflow context

Commands with post-completion guidance:
- flow-concept-to-inception
- flow-inception-to-elaboration
- flow-elaboration-to-construction
- flow-construction-to-transition
- flow-delivery-track
- flow-iteration-dual-track
- flow-gate-check
- flow-deploy-to-production
- flow-hypercare-monitoring

## Multi-Provider Skills

Skills now deploy successfully to Factory AI (previously Claude-only):

```bash
aiwg -deploy-agents --provider factory --mode sdlc --deploy-skills
```

## Upgrade

```bash
aiwg -update
aiwg use all  # Deploy new addons
```
