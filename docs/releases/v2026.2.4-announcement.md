# v2026.2.4 - "Issue Thread" Release

**Released**: February 9, 2026

This release introduces the `/address-issues` command — issue-thread-driven ralph loops that turn your issue tracker into a two-way collaboration surface between human and agent. It also adds context window budget configuration so users on local/GPU systems can declare their context limits and have AIWG auto-scale parallel subagent counts.

## Highlights

| What Changed | Why You Care |
|--------------|--------------|
| **`/address-issues` command** | Issue-thread-driven ralph loops with 2-way human-AI collaboration via issue comments |
| **Context window budget** | Configure `AIWG_CONTEXT_WINDOW` to control parallel subagent limits on local/GPU systems |
| **`--interactive` and `--guidance`** | Standard AIWG parameters for discovery prompts and upfront direction |

## Issue-Driven Ralph Loop

The `/address-issues` command transforms the issue tracker from a passive record into an active collaboration surface. Each ralph cycle posts structured status to the issue thread, scans for human feedback, and responds substantively. The human can monitor and steer agent work asynchronously by commenting on the issue — no need to be in the same terminal session.

### The 3-Step Cycle Protocol

```
Step 1: Work     — Read issue context, implement fix/feature, run tests
Step 2: Post     — Post structured RALPH CYCLE #N status comment to issue thread
Step 3: Scan     — Read new thread comments, classify, incorporate into next cycle
```

### Thread Scanning

Human comments are classified and acted on:

| Comment Type | Agent Response |
|-------------|----------------|
| Feedback | Incorporate into next cycle's work |
| Question | Answer in next status comment |
| Approval | Proceed to next phase or close issue |
| Correction | Adjust approach, acknowledge the change |

### Usage

```bash
# Address specific issues
/address-issues 17 18 19

# Work through all open bugs
/address-issues --filter "status:open label:bug"

# Interactive mode with discovery questions
/address-issues --all-open --interactive

# With guidance to tailor priorities
/address-issues --all-open --guidance "Focus on security bugs, skip feature requests"

# Branch per issue with higher cycle limit
/address-issues 17 --branch-per-issue --max-cycles 8
```

### Natural Language Triggers

Say any of these and AIWG routes to `/address-issues`:

- "address the open issues" / "fix open issues"
- "tackle issue 17" / "work on issue 17"
- "work through the bugs" / "work on the bug backlog"
- "go through the open tickets"
- "address issues 17, 18, 19 interactively"
- "fix the open bugs, focus on security issues first"

### What's Included

| Type | Artifact |
|------|----------|
| Command | `/address-issues` with full parameter support |
| Skill | `issue-driven-ralph` with NL trigger matching |
| NL Mappings | 12 phrase-to-command translations |
| Design Doc | `.aiwg/planning/issue-driven-ralph-loop-design.md` |
| Providers | Gitea (MCP tools) and GitHub (`gh` CLI) |

## Context Window Budget Configuration

Users running Claude Code on local GPU systems with smaller context windows (e.g., 100k tokens) can now declare their budget. The framework auto-scales parallel subagent limits accordingly.

### Configuration

Add to your CLAUDE.md team directives section:

```markdown
AIWG_CONTEXT_WINDOW: 100000
```

### Auto-Scaling Table

| Context Window | Max Parallel Subagents | Compaction Behavior |
|----------------|----------------------|---------------------|
| Unset (default) | No limit (platform decides) | Normal |
| ≤64k | 1-2 | Aggressive — prefer sequential |
| 65k-128k | 2-4 | Moderate — batch in groups of 2-3 |
| 129k-256k | 4-8 | Standard |
| 257k-512k | 8-12 | Relaxed |
| >512k | 12-20 | Normal (cloud default) |

**Formula**: `max_parallel = max(1, floor(context_window / 50000))` capped at 20.

### What's Included

| Type | Artifact |
|------|----------|
| Rule | `context-budget.md` (deploys to all 8 platforms) |
| Updated Rule | `subagent-scoping.md` Rule 7 references context budget |
| CLAUDE.md | Commented-out `AIWG_CONTEXT_WINDOW` directive |
