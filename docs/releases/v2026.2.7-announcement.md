# v2026.2.7 - "Media Curator" Release

**Released**: February 14, 2026

This release introduces the **Media Curator framework** — a complete AIWG framework for building and maintaining intelligent media archives. It provides 6 specialized agents, 9 commands, and 9 skills covering the full pipeline from discography analysis through multi-platform export.

## Highlights

| What Changed | Why You Care |
|--------------|--------------|
| **New media-curator framework** | Complete framework for AI-powered media archive management |
| **6 specialized agents** | Discography analysis, source discovery, acquisition, quality assessment, metadata curation, completeness tracking |
| **9 commands + 9 skills** | Full pipeline from `/analyze-artist` through `/export` |
| **Field-tested patterns** | GAP-NOTE.md, opustags, production-context classification — proven on 94GB prototype |
| **5 export profiles** | Plex, Jellyfin, MPD, mobile, archival — out of the box |

## The Framework

The Media Curator framework (`agentic/code/frameworks/media-curator/`) follows the standard AIWG pattern: specialized agents orchestrated via commands, with skills providing reusable capabilities.

```

### Usage Patterns

**Complete collection**:
```
"My favorite band is Radiohead — build me the complete collection"
```

**Targeted extraction**:
```
"I love early Metallica — Master of Puppets era, everything from that period"
```

**Event/tour focus**:
```
"Twenty One Pilots Bandito Tour — every pro-shot performance"
```

### Export Profiles

The framework ships with 5 pre-configured export profiles in `defaults.yaml`:

| Profile | Audio Formats | Video | Extras |
|---------|--------------|-------|--------|
| **Plex** | FLAC, MP3, M4A | MP4, MKV | folder.jpg |
| **Jellyfin** | FLAC, Opus, MP3 | MP4, MKV, WebM | folder.jpg, artist.jpg, NFO files |
| **MPD** | FLAC, Opus, MP3 | — | folder.jpg |
| **Mobile** | Opus, M4A, MP3 | 720p max | 500x500 artwork |
| **Archival** | FLAC, WAV | MKV | Checksums + provenance |

## Field-Tested Patterns

The framework incorporates learnings from a prototype session cataloging Twenty One Pilots' complete discography (1,109 files, 94GB):

### GAP-NOTE.md Pattern

Standardized markdown files placed in directories where content is expected but not yet acquired. They serve as agent instructions, enable parallel gap-filling, and provide completeness measurement by counting remaining gaps.

### opustags over Python mutagen

Field testing revealed `opustags` as the superior CLI tool for Opus metadata — faster, more reliable, and better suited for scripted workflows than Python-based alternatives.

### Production-Context Classification

Content is classified by production context (studio, live, broadcast) rather than sonic character. This produces more consistent, verifiable categories that align with how media archives are actually organized.

## Standards Compliance

- **MusicBrainz** — canonical discography data and Cover Art Archive
- **Discogs** — release identification and metadata
- **W3C PROV** — provenance tracking for all artifacts
- **PREMIS** — preservation metadata for archive integrity
- **SHA-256** — fixity verification with self-verifying manifests
- **ID3v2 / Vorbis Comments** — audio metadata tagging
