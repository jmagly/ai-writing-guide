# AIWG v1.6.0 Release: Voice Framework & Skills System

**Release Date**: December 8, 2025

We're excited to announce AIWG v1.6.0, a major release that introduces the **Voice Framework** addon and a comprehensive **Skills system** across all frameworks. This release fundamentally changes how you approach writing quality - from avoiding patterns to defining the voice you want.

## What's New

### Voice Framework: Define What You Want, Not What to Avoid

The Voice Framework replaces pattern-avoidance with positive voice definition. Instead of listing phrases to avoid, you now define the voice characteristics you want and let the framework apply them consistently.

**4 Built-in Voice Profiles:**

| Profile | Tone | Best For |
|---------|------|----------|
| `technical-authority` | Direct, precise, confident | API docs, architecture specs |
| `friendly-explainer` | Approachable, encouraging | Tutorials, onboarding guides |
| `executive-brief` | Concise, outcome-focused | Business cases, reports |
| `casual-conversational` | Relaxed, personal | Blog posts, newsletters |

**Usage is natural:**
```text
"Write this README in technical-authority voice"
"Make this documentation more friendly for beginners"
"Blend 70% technical with 30% friendly for our internal docs"
```

### Skills System: Context-Aware Capabilities

Claude Code Skills are now deployed automatically with your frameworks. Skills provide specialized capabilities that activate based on context.

**29 Skills across all frameworks:**
- **Voice Framework (4)**: voice-apply, voice-create, voice-blend, voice-analyze
- **Writing Quality (1)**: ai-pattern-detection
- **AIWG Utils (6)**: config-validator, project-awareness, and more
- **SDLC Framework (10)**: project-health, artifact-indexer, and more
- **Marketing Kit (8)**: campaign-tracker, content-scheduler, and more

### Improved CLI Experience

```bash
# New writing framework command
aiwg use writing           # Deploys Writing Quality + Voice Framework

# Deploy specific frameworks with skills
aiwg use sdlc              # 54 agents, 42 commands, 10 skills
aiwg use marketing         # 37 agents, 23 commands, 8 skills
aiwg use all               # Everything

# Explicit skill deployment
aiwg -deploy-agents --mode all --deploy-skills
```

## Quick Start

## Migration: From Banned Patterns to Voice Profiles

The `validation/banned-patterns.md` file is now deprecated. Here's how to migrate:

**Before (pattern avoidance):**
```text
"Write this article, avoiding phrases like 'delve into', 'it's important to note', 'in today's world'"
```

**After (voice definition):**
```text
"Write this article in technical-authority voice"
```

**Custom voice profiles:**

Create `.aiwg/voices/my-brand.yaml`:
```yaml
name: my-brand
description: Our company's documentation voice

tone:
  formality: 0.6        # 0=casual, 1=formal
  confidence: 0.8       # 0=tentative, 1=assertive
  warmth: 0.5           # 0=clinical, 1=personable

vocabulary:
  prefer:
    - "specifically"
    - "in practice"
  avoid:
    - "leverage"
    - "utilize"
```

Then use it:
```text
"Write this in my-brand voice"
```
