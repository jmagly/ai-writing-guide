# AIWG v2026.2.9 — "Manifest Native" Release

**Released**: 2026-02-15

This release completes provider normalization around manifest-driven discovery so framework/addon deployment no longer depends on scattered provider-specific curation. Codex now receives the same research and media-curator deployment coverage as the other providers.

## Highlights

| What changed | Why you care |
|--------------|--------------|
| Manifest-native provider deployment | Framework artifacts are discovered from manifests/shared utilities instead of hardcoded per-provider lists |
| Codex framework parity | Research and Media Curator components are now included through the same mode-aware discovery path |
| Lower maintenance overhead | Adding new frameworks/components is significantly more automatic once manifests are present |
| Test coverage updates | Integration and smoke tests now assert normalized provider behavior for framework deployment |

## Provider Normalization

All 8 providers now align on shared discovery behavior:

- Claude
- Codex (OpenAI)
- Copilot
- Cursor
- Factory
- OpenCode
- Warp
- Windsurf

Instead of each provider manually curating framework directories, deployment now uses centralized manifest-aware helpers to resolve frameworks and artifacts by mode.

## Codex: Research + Media Curator Coverage

Codex deployment scripts now use framework discovery for command and skill selection, which closes gaps where newly added frameworks could be missed in Codex-specific install paths.

### What this enables

```bash
# These now deploy consistently for Codex via the normalized discovery path
aiwg use research --provider codex
aiwg use media-curator --provider codex
```

## Manifest-Driven Extensibility

A framework with a valid `manifest.json` and standard component layout is now discoverable by provider deployment without requiring one-off changes in each provider module.

This release also adds explicit manifest metadata for `research-complete` to support that flow.

## Install / Update

```bash
npm install -g aiwg@2026.2.9

# Or update existing installation
aiwg update
```
