# v2026.1.7 - "Deploy All Commands" Release

**Released**: January 14, 2026

This release removes priority filtering from command deployment, ensuring ALL commands from core addons are deployed to all providers.

## Highlights

| What Changed | Why You Care |
|--------------|--------------|
| **Removed priority filtering** | ALL commands now deploy (not just a curated subset) |
| **aiwg-utils commands work** | `aiwg-regenerate*`, `devkit-*`, `mention-*` commands now deploy to Codex/Cursor |

## What Changed

Previously, the Codex and Cursor deployment scripts filtered commands to only deploy a "priority" subset. This meant many useful commands from `aiwg-utils` (like context regeneration, devkit scaffolding, and mention utilities) weren't available on these platforms.

### Before

```
# Only ~15 "priority" commands deployed
deploy-prompts-codex.mjs: filterByPriority(commands)
deploy-rules-cursor.mjs: filterByPriority(commands)
```

### After

```
# ALL commands from core addons deployed
deploy-prompts-codex.mjs: deployAll(commands)
deploy-rules-cursor.mjs: deployAll(commands)
```

## Commands Now Available

The `aiwg-utils` addon now deploys all 30 commands including:

| Category | Commands |
|----------|----------|
| Context Regeneration | `aiwg-regenerate*` (claude, warp, agents, copilot, cursorrules, factory, windsurfrules) |
| Devkit Scaffolding | `devkit-create-addon`, `devkit-create-agent`, `devkit-create-command`, `devkit-create-extension`, `devkit-create-framework`, `devkit-create-skill`, `devkit-test`, `devkit-validate` |
| Mention Utilities | `mention-conventions`, `mention-lint`, `mention-report`, `mention-validate`, `mention-wire` |
| Workspace | `workspace-prune-working`, `workspace-realign`, `workspace-reset` |

## Installation

```bash
npm update -g aiwg
aiwg use all  # Redeploy with all commands
```
