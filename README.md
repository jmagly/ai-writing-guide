## 🎬 See It In Action

### Writing Quality: Before & After

<details>
<summary><strong>❌ AI-Generated (Detected)</strong></summary>

```markdown
In today's rapidly evolving landscape of artificial intelligence,
it's worth noting that leveraging cutting-edge solutions can
significantly enhance your workflow. Our comprehensive approach
delves into the intricacies of modern development paradigms...
```

**Problems:** Vague claims, buzzwords, no specifics, formulaic structure

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>✅ Human-Authentic (Validated)</strong></summary>

```markdown
AI code assistants save developers 30-40% of their time on
boilerplate and documentation. But they introduce a new problem:
detecting and removing performative language that screams "I was
written by ChatGPT."

This framework solves that. 485 documents, 19 validation rules,
100+ banned phrases. Ship faster. Write better.
```

**Improvements:** Specific metrics, concrete problem, direct solution, natural voice

</details>

### SDLC Workflow: Inception → Production

```bash
# 1. Generate project intake (5 minutes, replaces 2-4 hours manual work)
/project:intake-wizard "Build customer portal with real-time chat"

# 2. Validate vision and approve phase transition (automated gate check)
/project:flow-inception-to-elaboration

# 3. Generate architecture document with multi-agent review
#    (Primary Author → 4 Parallel Reviewers → Synthesizer → Baseline)
"Create Software Architecture Document"

# 4. Execute dual-track iteration (Discovery + Delivery in parallel)
/project:flow-iteration-dual-track 3

# 5. Deploy to production with automated rollback strategy
/project:flow-deploy-to-production
```

**Time Savings:** 20-98% reduction across 5 core use cases. See [Use Case Briefs](.aiwg/requirements/use-case-briefs/) for quantified ROI.

## 🧩 Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Remove AI Detection Patterns

**Problem:** ChatGPT wrote your docs. Everyone can tell.

**Solution:** Validate content against 100+ banned patterns, get before/after rewrites.

```bash
# Deploy writing-validator agent
aiwg -deploy-agents --mode general

# Validate any document
"Check this document for AI patterns: docs/architecture.md"
```

**Time Saved:** 56-63% (56-126 minutes → 30-45 minutes)

---

### Use Case 2: Deploy Full SDLC Framework (2 Minutes)

**Problem:** Copying templates manually takes 6+ hours. You do it once and never update them.

**Solution:** One command deploys 58 agents + 45 commands + 156 templates.

```bash
aiwg -deploy-agents --mode sdlc
```

**Time Saved:** 98% (6 hours → 10 seconds)

---

### Use Case 3: Generate Intake From Existing Codebase

**Problem:** Brownfield project. No docs. Need to baseline for new team members.

**Solution:** Analyze codebase, generate comprehensive intake automatically.

```bash
/project:intake-from-codebase .
```

**Output:** Project intake, solution profile, option matrix (3 documents, 5,000+ words)

**Time Saved:** 81-85% (2-3.5 hours → 20-35 minutes)

---

### Use Case 4: Multi-Agent Architecture Review

**Problem:** Architecture docs need multiple perspectives (security, testing, operations).

**Solution:** Orchestrate parallel reviews, synthesize feedback, baseline artifact.

```bash
"Create Software Architecture Document with multi-agent review"
```

**Workflow:** Primary Author → 4 Parallel Reviewers → Synthesizer → Baseline

**Time Saved:** 92-96% (9-15 hours → 45-60 minutes)

---

### Use Case 5: Framework Self-Improvement Loop

**Problem:** Framework needs dogfooding. How do you use SDLC tools to improve SDLC tools?

**Solution:** Use framework on itself. Generate artifacts, track velocity, iterate.

**Current Status:** 100% Inception artifact coverage (vision, business case, risks, architecture)

**Meta-Validation:** If the framework can manage itself, it can manage your project.

**Time Saved:** 20-30% overhead reduction per iteration (5-8 hours → 3-5 hours)

---
