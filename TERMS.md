# Terms of Use

**Last Updated:** October 17, 2025
**Effective Date:** October 17, 2025

## Overview

The AIWG framework ("the Software") is an **agent toolset and prompting framework** for process automation, provided under the MIT License as open-source software.

**Current Features:**
- **Writing Quality utilities** — Remove AI detection patterns, validate content
- **SDLC Complete framework** — Comprehensive agents, commands, and templates for software lifecycle management

**Future Expansion:**
- Additional process frameworks (business analysis, content strategy, research synthesis, decision-making, etc.)
- See roadmap for planned frameworks

By installing, deploying, or using this software, you agree to these terms.

## Acceptance of Terms

**Use constitutes acceptance.** If you do not agree to these terms, do not install or use the Software.

## License Grant

The Software is licensed under the **MIT License** (see LICENSE file). You may:

- Use the Software for any purpose (personal, commercial, educational)
- Modify the Software and create derivative works
- Distribute copies of the Software
- Sublicense and sell copies of derivative works

**Subject to the conditions** in the MIT License (preserve copyright notice and permission notice).

## Experimental / Testing Status

**IMPORTANT**: This Software is in **active development and testing** (Phase 1: 0-3 months post-launch).

**What this means:**

- **Breaking changes** may occur without notice
- **Incomplete features** or documentation gaps exist
- **Bugs and logic errors** are expected (prompts function as executable software in agentic environments)
- **API compatibility** may change between versions
- **Not recommended** for production-critical projects without thorough independent testing
- **Only two process frameworks currently available** (Writing Quality + SDLC Complete)

**Rate limits are handled automatically** by agentic tools (no manual timeout management required).

**Document rollback is optional** and user-controlled. Enable version history by committing `.aiwg/` artifacts to git, or add `.aiwg/` to `.gitignore` for local-only use.

**You acknowledge** that you are using experimental software at your own risk.

## No Warranty

**AS-IS BASIS**: The Software is provided "AS IS", without warranty of any kind, express or implied.
