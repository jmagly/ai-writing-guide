**Additions**:
1. Development Tools traceability note (Section 4.3) - 5 minutes
2. Plugin signing decision timeline (Section 11.1 Q2) - 2 minutes
3. Multi-platform metadata note (Appendix B) - 10 minutes

**Expected Quality After Implementation**: 96/100 (from 92/100)

## Addition 1: Development Tools Traceability (Section 4.3)

### Location
**Section**: 4.3 Development View - Module Structure
**Insert After**: Line 269 (after closing ``` of directory structure)
**Insert Before**: "**Component Class Diagram**:" heading

### Text to Add

```markdown
**Traceability Note**: This module structure extends existing AIWG Development Tools (project-intake.md lines 67-72: "Development Tools Used"):

- **`tools/plugins/`** extends existing `tools/agents/deploy-agents.mjs` with normalized plugin architecture
  - Generalizes agent deployment to support platform integrations, compliance add-ons, and vertical extensions
  - Introduces manifest-driven approach (plugin.yaml) for discovery and installation
- **`tools/contributor/`** extends project scaffolding capabilities (intake-wizard, new-project.mjs)
  - Adds fork-develop-test-PR workflow with isolated workspaces (`.aiwg/contrib/`)
  - Implements automated quality gates reducing review burden by 50%
- **`tools/traceability/`** implements P1 integration work (inception-roadmap-integration.md lines 95-98: "Integration & Traceability (56h)")
  - Graph-based requirements-to-deployment traceability automation
  - Replaces manual CSV maintenance with metadata parsing
- **`tools/metrics/`** implements P1 integration work (inception-roadmap-integration.md lines 95-98: "Metrics & Measurement (35h)")
  - Contribution velocity tracking (commits/day, PRs/week)
  - Quality score aggregation (DORA metrics, test coverage)

**Development Stack Alignment**:
- Node.js >=18.20.8 (project-intake.md line 24: "- Node.js tooling")
- GitHub CLI (gh) integration (project-intake.md line 25: "- GitHub integration for workflows")
- Multi-provider support via platform adapters (project-intake.md line 26: "- Multi-provider AIWG support (Claude/OpenAI/Cursor)")
```

### Justification

**Traceability Linkage**:
- **Source**: project-intake.md lines 67-72 (Development Tools)
- **Gap**: SAD Section 4.3 lists module directories but doesn't explicitly connect to intake requirements
- **Impact**: Clarifies how contributor workflow extends existing AIWG tooling vs. creating net-new infrastructure

**Coverage Improvement**: INT-08, INT-09, INT-10 (Tech Stack) now have explicit references in architecture, not just §7.1 Core Technologies

## Addition 2: Plugin Signing Decision Timeline (Section 11.1 Q2)

### Location
**Section**: 11.1 Open Questions
**Replace**: Lines 964-965 (entire Q2 text)

### Text to Replace

**BEFORE**:
```markdown
2. **Plugin Signing**: Should we require signed plugins for security?
   - Current thinking: Optional initially, required for "verified" badge
```

**AFTER**:
```markdown
2. **Plugin Signing**: Should we require signed plugins for security?
   - Current thinking: Optional initially, required for "verified" badge
   - **Decision Required By**: End of Elaboration phase (Week 12, 2025-12-29)
   - **Gates Construction Phase**: Plugin signing strategy must be finalized before scaling to 10+ contributors in Construction
   - **Owner**: Security Architect (in coordination with Architecture Designer)
   - **Impact if Deferred**: Cannot implement "verified plugin" badge system, may require breaking change to plugin manifest schema post-MVP
```

### Justification

**Traceability Linkage**:
- **Source**: Security posture (project-intake.md lines 159-173) + Scalability planning (project-intake.md lines 137-155)
- **Gap**: No timeline for plugin signing decision creates ambiguity for Construction phase security work
- **Impact**: Elaboration phase must retire this risk before Construction begins (per SDLC gate criteria)

**Coverage Improvement**: Clarifies that plugin signing is an **Elaboration exit criteria** (NFR-05 Plugin Isolation may require signing for production-grade security)

## Addition 3: Multi-Platform Metadata Note (Appendix B)

### Location
**Section**: Appendix B: Traceability Metadata Format
**Insert After**: Line 1164 (after Test Metadata code block)
**Insert Before**: "### Appendix C: Quality Gate Configuration" heading

### Text to Add

### Multi-Platform Traceability Considerations

**Future Extension Path**: When multi-platform contributor workflow is implemented (Phase 3+, per vision-document.md lines 699-707: "Defer Multi-Platform Until Validation"), traceability metadata will support platform-specific references.

**Current Scope (MVP)**: Claude Code only (.claude/agents/, .claude/commands/)

**Planned Extension (Phase 3+)**: Multi-platform deployment metadata

**Example: Multi-Platform Code Metadata**
```javascript
/**
 * @implements UC-01
 * @component PluginLoader
 * @traces-to SAD-PLUGIN-01
 * @platforms claude,openai,cursor
 * @deploy-paths {
 *   "claude": ".claude/agents/plugin-loader.md",
 *   "openai": "AGENTS.md#plugin-loader",
 *   "cursor": ".cursor/agents/plugin-loader.md"
 * }
 */
class PluginLoader {
  // Implementation
}
```

**Example: Multi-Platform Test Metadata**
```javascript
/**
 * @tests UC-01
 * @validates SAD-PLUGIN-01
 * @covers PluginLoader.install
 * @platforms claude,openai,cursor
 * @platform-specific-tests {
 *   "claude": "test/claude/plugin-loader.test.mjs",
 *   "openai": "test/openai/agents-md-generation.test.mjs",
 *   "cursor": "test/cursor/plugin-loader.test.mjs"
 * }
 */
describe('Plugin Installation (Multi-Platform)', () => {
  // Platform-agnostic tests
});
```

**Traceability Graph Extension**:
When multi-platform support is implemented, the traceability graph (NetworkX) will track:
- **Platform Nodes**: Each deployment target (Claude, OpenAI, Cursor, Windsurf, Zed)
- **Platform Edges**: Requirements → Architecture → Implementation → Tests → Deployment per platform
- **Coverage Validation**: Ensure UC-01 has implementation + tests for all supported platforms

**Metadata Format Decision Timeline**:
- **Elaboration Phase (Weeks 5-12)**: Finalize metadata format for Claude-only MVP
- **Construction Phase (Weeks 13-20)**: Implement traceability automation for Claude
- **Transition Phase (Weeks 21-24)**: Validate with self-application
- **Phase 3 (Future)**: Extend metadata format to support multi-platform (backward-compatible)

**Traceability Note**: This extension path is acknowledged in vision-document.md lines 699-707 (Strategic Decision: "Defer Multi-Platform Until Validation") and project-intake.md lines 88-92 (Planned Work: "Multi-platform refactor to improve platform adapter abstraction").
```

### Justification

**Traceability Linkage**:
- **Source**: project-intake.md lines 88-92 (Planned: Multi-platform refactor) + vision-document.md lines 699-707 (Decision: Defer multi-platform)
- **Gap**: Appendix B shows metadata format but doesn't address how it scales to multi-platform
- **Impact**: Clarifies that current metadata format is MVP-scoped and has backward-compatible extension path

**Coverage Improvement**:
- INT-10 (Tech: Multi-provider support) now has explicit traceability path in metadata format
- VIS-33 (Decision: Defer Multi-Platform) is validated by showing extension path without overcommitting
