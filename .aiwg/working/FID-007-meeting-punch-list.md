# Elaboration Phase Features - Quick Punch List

**Meeting Date**: 2025-10-18
**Phase**: Elaboration (Week 1 of 10)
**Total P0 Features**: 7 features, 297 hours, 10 weeks

---

## CRITICAL BLOCKER: FID-007 (Week 2-4)

**Framework-Scoped Workspace Management** - MUST complete first, blocks all other features

**What**: 4-tier workspace architecture for managing multiple concurrent projects/features
- **Tier 1: Repo/System** - Global stable docs (feature lists, versions, intake)
- **Tier 2: Projects/Features** - Active development artifacts (epic-level work)
- **Tier 3: Working Area** - Temporary collaboration space (cleaned regularly)
- **Tier 4: Archive** - Completed/historical artifacts

**Why Critical**:
- Current flat structure causes context pollution (old docs interfere with new work)
- Need to support multiple concurrent features/epics (async processing)
- Enable polyglot process management (SDLC + Marketing + Agile frameworks coexist)

**Key Innovation**: Implicit framework detection via metadata (no manual framework selection)
- User says "Transition to Elaboration" → auto-routes to SDLC framework
- User says "Generate blog content" → auto-routes to Marketing framework
- Zero friction, zero user thought required

**Effort**: 80 hours
**Timeline**: Week 2-4 (Nov 21 - Dec 12)
**Deliverables**:
- Framework registry system
- Workspace tier management
- Command/agent metadata standards
- Natural language routing logic
- Migration tooling for existing .aiwg/ artifacts

## Remaining P0 Features (Week 5-10)

### #1: FID-001 - Enhanced Security Gates (40h, Week 5-7)
**What**: SAST/DAST integration, credential scanning, dependency audits
**Why**: Strengthen security validation before phase transitions
**Status**: Detailed design in UC-001, ready for implementation after FID-007

### #2: FID-006 - Automated Release Notes (32h, Week 7-8)
**What**: Generate release notes from git commits + ADRs + use cases
**Why**: Reduce manual documentation burden, ensure consistency
**Status**: Detailed design in UC-006, ready for implementation

### #3: FID-002 - Test Coverage Analytics (48h, Week 8-10)
**What**: Track coverage, identify gaps, enforce thresholds
**Why**: Ensure comprehensive testing before releases
**Status**: Detailed design in UC-002, ready for implementation

### #4: FID-003 - Architecture Drift Detection (40h, Week 9-10)
**What**: Compare implemented architecture vs SAD baseline
**Why**: Prevent architecture erosion, enforce governance
**Status**: Detailed design in UC-003, ready for implementation

### #5: FID-004 - Requirements Traceability Validation (32h, Week 10)
**What**: Automated bi-directional trace validation (req ↔ code ↔ tests)
**Why**: Ensure complete coverage, detect orphans
**Status**: Detailed design in UC-004, ready for implementation

### #6: FID-005 - Deployment Health Dashboard (25h, Week 10)
**What**: Real-time monitoring, SLO tracking, incident correlation
**Why**: Improve operational visibility, reduce MTTR
**Status**: Detailed design in UC-005, ready for implementation

## Timeline Summary

| Week | Focus | Effort | Deliverable |
|------|-------|--------|-------------|
| 1 (Nov 14-20) | Planning | 15h | Phase plan, backlog triage, use cases |
| 2-4 (Nov 21 - Dec 12) | **FID-007** | **80h** | **Workspace architecture (BLOCKER)** |
| 5-7 (Dec 13 - Jan 2) | FID-001 | 40h | Security gates |
| 7-8 (Dec 27 - Jan 8) | FID-006 | 32h | Release notes |
| 8-10 (Jan 2 - Jan 15) | FID-002 | 48h | Test coverage |
| 9-10 (Jan 9 - Jan 15) | FID-003 | 40h | Architecture drift |
| 10 (Jan 9-15) | FID-004, FID-005 | 57h | Traceability + Dashboard |

**Note**: Weeks overlap due to parallel work on independent features

## Key Metrics

- **Total P0 Effort**: 297 hours (37.1 hours/week average for solo developer)
- **Elaboration Duration**: 10 weeks (Nov 14 - Jan 15, 2026)
- **Critical Path**: FID-007 (blocks all other features due to workspace dependencies)
- **Risk**: Tight timeline if FID-007 slips (no buffer in schedule)

---

## Recommendation

**Prioritize FID-007 completion by Dec 12** to unblock remaining features. If timeline pressure increases, consider:
1. Defer FID-005 (Deployment Dashboard) to Construction phase (least dependencies)
2. Reduce FID-002 (Test Coverage) scope to MVP (focus on unit test coverage only)
3. Parallel FID-001 (Security) with FID-006 (Release Notes) in Week 7-8 if FID-007 completes early

---

## Next Steps (Immediate)

1. **Week 1 (This Week)**: Complete Elaboration planning artifacts (✓ DONE)
2. **Week 2 (Nov 21)**: Begin FID-007 implementation (workspace architecture)
3. **Daily Standups**: Monitor FID-007 progress (critical path item)
4. **Week 4 Review (Dec 12)**: Gate decision - proceed with remaining P0s or re-plan
