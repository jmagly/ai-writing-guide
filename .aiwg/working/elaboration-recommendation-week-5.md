---

```yaml
document: Elaboration Recommendation
iteration: Elaboration Week 5
version: 1.0
status: FINAL
created: 2025-10-22
project: AI Writing Guide - SDLC Framework
phase: Elaboration
purpose: Recommend P0 use case elaboration strategy for Week 5 based on Product Strategist feature prioritization
```

---

## Executive Summary

**Context**: Elaboration Week 4 successfully completed UC-005 (Framework Self-Improvement) elaboration (8,542 words, 12 ACs, 30 test cases). Product Strategist review identified 5 P0 features (FID-000, FID-001, FID-003, FID-004, FID-006) for MVP and deferred 2 features to P1 (FID-002, FID-005).

**Current State**:
- 2 use cases fully elaborated (UC-001, UC-005) - 18% complete
- 3 use cases partially elaborated (UC-002, UC-003, UC-004) - 27% in progress
- 6 use cases minimal placeholders (UC-006 through UC-011) - 55% pending

**Recommendation**: Elaborate 4 P0 use cases in Elaboration Week 5 (UC-006, UC-008, UC-009, UC-011) to achieve Construction phase readiness.

**Estimated Effort**: 22-28 hours (P0 only), target completion by end of Week 5

**Impact**:
- All P0 features baselined for Construction (6/11 use cases fully elaborated = 54%)
- Clear P1 roadmap (UC-007, UC-010 deferred to Construction Week 1 with manual workarounds)
- Construction GO decision achievable by end of Week 5

## 1. P0 Use Cases Requiring Elaboration

### 1.1 Use Case Priority Classification

Based on Product Strategist P0 feature prioritization, **4 use cases** require full elaboration in Week 5:

| Use Case | Feature ID | P0 Rationale | Current Status | Target Elaboration |
|----------|-----------|--------------|----------------|-------------------|
| **UC-006** | **FID-001** | **Enterprise adoption blocker** - Regulated industries require 100% requirements-to-code traceability for compliance (SOC2, FDA, ISO) | 94 words (placeholder) | 3,000-3,500 words, 14-16 ACs, 22-25 test cases |
| **UC-008** | **FID-003** | **Onboarding friction reduction** - 50% time reduction target makes framework accessible to solo developers (not just enterprises) | 94 words (placeholder) | 2,000-2,500 words, 10-12 ACs, 15-18 test cases |
| **UC-009** | **FID-004** | **Quality enabler** - Reduces manual test writing burden, enables 80%/70%/50% coverage targets (unit/integration/E2E) | 95 words (placeholder) | 2,500-3,000 words, 12-14 ACs, 18-22 test cases |
| **UC-011** | **FID-006** | **Security table stakes** - Prevents malicious plugins, builds trust for enterprise adoption | 95 words (placeholder) | 2,800-3,200 words, 13-15 ACs, 20-24 test cases |

**Total Week 5 Deliverable**: ~10,300-12,200 words, 49-57 ACs, 75-89 test cases, 19-26 NFRs

### 1.2 Why These 4 Use Cases Are P0

**UC-006 (Traceability Automation) - Enterprise Blocker**:
- Regulated industries (healthcare, finance, government) require 100% requirements-to-code traceability for compliance audits
- SOC2, FDA, ISO certifications mandate traceability evidence
- Without automated traceability, framework loses enterprise market segment (50% of addressable market)
- Manual traceability too labor-intensive for enterprise adoption

**UC-008 (Template Selection) - Adoption Barrier**:
- Solo developers overwhelmed by 156 templates in framework (choice paralysis)
- 50% onboarding time reduction target makes framework accessible to solo developers
- Template pack recommendation (lean, balanced, enterprise) simplifies first-time user experience
- First impression critical - 70% of users abandon if setup >15 minutes

**UC-009 (Test Templates) - Quality Gate**:
- Test strategy template defines quality standards for Construction phase
- 80%/70%/50% coverage targets (unit/integration/E2E) need specification before Construction
- Reduces manual test writing burden (productivity multiplier)
- Enables multi-agent test artifact generation (depends on UC-004 orchestration)

**UC-011 (Security Validation) - Security Table Stakes**:
- Prevents malicious plugins (path traversal, YAML bombs, injection attacks)
- Enterprise blocker - cannot deploy untrusted plugins without security validation
- 100% attack detection for known vectors (P0 NFR)
- User approval workflow for sensitive operations (file permissions, external dependencies)

### 1.3 UC-005 Already Complete (No Week 5 Work Needed)

**UC-005 (Framework Self-Improvement) - P0 Feature FID-000**:
- **Status**: FULLY ELABORATED (Week 4)
- **Quality**: 8,542 words, 12 ACs, 30 test cases, 8 NFRs
- **Assessment**: EXCEPTIONAL (98/100 per Product Strategist review)
- **Recommendation**: NO ADDITIONAL ELABORATION NEEDED

UC-005 already meets all P0 requirements for Construction. No Week 5 effort required.

## 2. P1 Use Cases for Deferral

### 2.1 Use Cases Deferred to Construction Week 1

Based on Product Strategist recommendations, **2 use cases** deferred to P1 (Version 1.1 - 3 months post-MVP):

| Use Case | Feature ID | P1 Rationale | Deferral Justification | Manual Workaround |
|----------|-----------|--------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| **UC-007** | **FID-002** | **Observability feature** - Metrics nice-to-have, not core value | Early adopters accept manual metrics via `.aiwg/reports/` artifacts | Inspect retrospectives, iteration summaries manually |
| **UC-010** | **FID-005** | **Risk mitigation** - Rollback rarely needed pre-production | Git-based workaround acceptable for MVP | `git reset --hard <commit>` + `aiwg -uninstall` |

**Total P1 Effort**: 8-10 hours (defer to Construction Week 1 if Week 5 time-constrained)

### 2.2 Why UC-007 and UC-010 Are P1 (Not P0)

**UC-007 (Metrics Collection) - P1 Rationale**:
- **Product Strategist**: "Metrics nice-to-have, not core value - manual workaround via logs acceptable"
- **Manual Workaround**: Users inspect `.aiwg/reports/` for velocity, test coverage, story points
- **User Impact**: LOW (early adopters tolerate manual metrics inspection)
- **Value Proposition**: Observability enhances framework but isn't a blocker
- **Version 1.1 Enhancement**: Automated metrics collection, historical trends, real-time dashboards

**UC-010 (Plugin Rollback) - P1 Rationale**:
- **Product Strategist**: "Rollback rarely needed pre-production - manual workaround acceptable for MVP"
- **Manual Workaround**: `git reset --hard <commit-before-install>` + `aiwg -uninstall`
- **User Impact**: LOW (rollback rarely needed, git-based workflow acceptable)
- **Value Proposition**: Safety net for failed installations, but not primary value
- **Version 1.1 Enhancement**: Automated rollback (<5s), data integrity validation, orphan cleanup

### 2.3 Product Strategist Trade-Off Decision

**Scope Reduction Recommendation** (Product Strategist Review):
- **Option A** (Full P0 Scope): 7 features, 48 NFRs → Timeline risk HIGH (50% chance of delay)
- **Option B** (Reduced P0 Scope): 5 features, 12 NFRs → Timeline confidence 90% (RECOMMENDED)
- **Option C** (Hybrid): 6 features, 20 NFRs → Timeline risk MEDIUM (70% confidence)

**Strategic Decision**: **Option B** (5 features, 12 P0 NFRs)
- **Keep P0**: FID-000, FID-001, FID-003, FID-004, FID-006
- **Defer to P1**: FID-002 (Metrics), FID-005 (Rollback)
- **Impact**: +2 weeks earlier MVP delivery, smaller scope increases delivery confidence

**Business Rationale**:
1. **Market Timing**: Earlier MVP delivery enables faster user feedback loop
2. **Resource Alignment**: 5 features + 12 NFRs match team capacity
3. **Value Focus**: Core differentiators (meta-application, traceability, security) prioritized
4. **Risk Mitigation**: Deferred features have manual workarounds documented

---

## 3. Recommended Elaboration Order

### 3.1 Priority Sequence (High → Low Complexity)

**Rationale**: Start with highest complexity (UC-006) on Monday to maximize available time. End with lowest complexity (UC-008) on Thursday for quick win.

**Week 5 Elaboration Schedule** (25-30 hours available):

| Priority | Day | Use Case | Complexity | Effort | Cumulative | Rationale |
|---------|-----|----------|-----------|--------|-----------|-----------|
| **1** | **Monday** | UC-006 (Traceability) | HIGH | 8-10 hours | 8-10 hours | Highest complexity, needs most time, enterprise blocker |
| **2** | **Tuesday** | UC-011 (Security) | MEDIUM-HIGH | 6-8 hours | 14-18 hours | Security gate for deployment, attack detection complexity |
| **3** | **Wednesday** | UC-009 (Test Templates) | MEDIUM | 5-6 hours | 19-24 hours | Quality gate for Construction, orchestration dependency |
| **4** | **Thursday** | UC-008 (Template Selection) | LOW | 3-4 hours | 22-28 hours | Quick win, onboarding experience, simple workflow |
| **5** | **Friday** | UC-007 (Metrics - P1) OR Buffer | MEDIUM (optional) | 4-5 hours | 26-33 hours | Optional if all P0 complete, otherwise buffer |

### 3.2 Complexity Justification

**UC-006 (Traceability) - HIGH Complexity**:
- **Technical Challenges**: Graph algorithms (NetworkX), 10,000+ node performance optimization, orphan detection
- **NFR Count**: 6-8 NFRs (performance, accuracy, completeness, scalability)
- **Integration**: Metadata parsers (requirements, architecture, code), impact analyzer
- **Test Scenarios**: 22-25 test cases (graph validation, orphan detection, impact analysis)

**UC-011 (Security Validation) - MEDIUM-HIGH Complexity**:
- **Technical Challenges**: Attack detection (path traversal, YAML bombs, injection), user approval workflow, dependency verification
- **NFR Count**: 5-7 NFRs (security, performance, accuracy, usability)
- **Integration**: PathValidator, InjectionValidator, DependencyVerifier, SHA-256 hash verification
- **Test Scenarios**: 20-24 test cases (attack vectors, user approval flows, false positives)

**UC-009 (Test Templates) - MEDIUM Complexity**:
- **Technical Challenges**: Multi-agent orchestration (depends on UC-004), test suite comprehensiveness, coverage targets
- **NFR Count**: 5-7 NFRs (performance, quality, completeness, usability)
- **Integration**: Test Engineer agent, template library (strategy, plan, automation, performance, security, E2E)
- **Test Scenarios**: 18-22 test cases (test generation, coverage validation, CI/CD integration)

**UC-008 (Template Selection) - LOW Complexity**:
- **Technical Challenges**: Project type detection, template pack recommendation (lean, balanced, enterprise)
- **NFR Count**: 3-4 NFRs (performance, usability, accuracy)
- **Integration**: Template library lookup (156 templates), intake-wizard command
- **Test Scenarios**: 15-18 test cases (project type detection, pack selection, user experience)

### 3.3 Decision Gate (End of Thursday)

**Checkpoint**: 22-28 hours elapsed by end of Thursday (all P0 UCs complete)

**Decision Options**:
- ✅ **If all P0 UCs complete**: Add UC-007 (Metrics - P1) on Friday (4-5 hours)
- ⚠️ **If UC-006 overran**: Use Friday as buffer to complete P0 UCs
- ❌ **UC-010 (Rollback)**: Defer to Construction Week 1 regardless (lowest priority P1)

**Risk Mitigation**:
- **Buffer built in**: UC-006 (8-10 hours) has 2-hour range for overruns
- **Scope flexibility**: UC-008 (LOW complexity) can be compressed to 2.5 hours if needed
- **P1 deferral clear**: UC-007, UC-010 have manual workarounds documented

## 4. Critical Path Validation

### 4.1 Use Case Dependencies

**Dependency Graph** (P0 use cases):

```
UC-002 (Deploy SDLC Framework) [PARTIALLY ELABORATED]
  ↓ (security gate)
  └── UC-011 (Security Validation) [WEEK 5 - PRIORITY 2]
      ↓ (gates deployment)
      └── UC-003, UC-004 [PARTIALLY ELABORATED]
          ↓ (enables)
          └── UC-009 (Test Templates) [WEEK 5 - PRIORITY 3]

UC-006 (Traceability) [WEEK 5 - PRIORITY 1]
  ↓ (feeds data to)
  └── UC-007 (Metrics) [P1 - DEFER TO CONSTRUCTION]

UC-008 (Template Selection) [WEEK 5 - PRIORITY 4]

  └── UC-009 (Test Templates) [WEEK 5 - PRIORITY 3]

UC-005 (Meta-Application) [COMPLETE - WEEK 4]
  ↓ (depends on)
  └── UC-003 (Intake from Codebase) [PARTIALLY ELABORATED]
```

**Critical Path for Construction**:
1. ✅ UC-002 (Deploy) - Basic structure sufficient (2,456 words, expand in Construction Week 1)
2. ✅ UC-011 (Security) - WEEK 5 PRIORITY 2 (gates UC-002 deployment)
3. ✅ UC-008 (Template Selection) - WEEK 5 PRIORITY 4 (onboarding experience)
4. ✅ UC-006 (Traceability) - WEEK 5 PRIORITY 1 (enterprise compliance)
5. ✅ UC-009 (Test Templates) - WEEK 5 PRIORITY 3 (quality gate)
6. ✅ UC-005 (Meta-Application) - COMPLETE (Week 4) (differentiation)

**All P0 critical path use cases covered by Week 5 elaboration.**

### 4.2 Construction Readiness Assessment

**Target State by End of Week 5**:

| Use Case | Status | Construction Readiness |
|----------|--------|----------------------|
| UC-001 | ✅ FULLY ELABORATED (4,287 words) | ✅ READY (AI validation reference) |
| UC-005 | ✅ FULLY ELABORATED (8,542 words) | ✅ READY (Meta-application complete) |
| UC-006 | ✅ FULLY ELABORATED (Week 5) | ✅ READY (Enterprise traceability) |
| UC-008 | ✅ FULLY ELABORATED (Week 5) | ✅ READY (Onboarding experience) |
| UC-009 | ✅ FULLY ELABORATED (Week 5) | ✅ READY (Quality gate) |
| UC-011 | ✅ FULLY ELABORATED (Week 5) | ✅ READY (Security gate) |
| UC-002 | ⚠️ PARTIALLY ELABORATED (2,456 words) | ⚠️ EXPAND IN CONST WEEK 1 (deployment foundation) |
| UC-003 | ⚠️ BASIC STRUCTURE (1,342 words) | ⚠️ EXPAND IN CONST WEEK 2 (brownfield support) |
| UC-004 | ⚠️ MODERATE DETAIL (2,178 words) | ⚠️ EXPAND IN CONST WEEK 1 (orchestration) |
| UC-007 | ⚠️ PLACEHOLDER (P1) | ⚠️ ELABORATE IN CONST WEEK 1 (metrics) |
| UC-010 | ⚠️ PLACEHOLDER (P1) | ⚠️ ELABORATE IN CONST WEEK 1 (rollback) |

**Construction Readiness**: 6/11 use cases fully elaborated (54%) - **GO decision achievable**

**Rationale for Partial Elaboration**:
- UC-002, UC-003, UC-004 have basic structures (1,342-2,456 words) sufficient for Construction start
- Developers implementing features will identify missing scenarios (just-in-time elaboration)
- Requirements Analyst embedded in Construction iterations (daily availability for expansion)

## 5. Effort Estimation and Timeline

### 5.1 Detailed Effort Breakdown

**Elaboration Effort** (based on UC-005 reference baseline: 8,542 words = 10-12 hours):

| Use Case | Complexity | Word Count Target | ACs | Test Cases | NFRs | Estimated Hours |
|----------|-----------|------------------|-----|-----------|------|----------------|
| UC-006 (Traceability) | HIGH | 3,000-3,500 words | 14-16 | 22-25 | 6-8 | **8-10 hours** |
| UC-011 (Security) | MEDIUM-HIGH | 2,800-3,200 words | 13-15 | 20-24 | 5-7 | **6-8 hours** |

| UC-008 (Template Selection) | LOW | 2,000-2,500 words | 10-12 | 15-18 | 3-4 | **3-4 hours** |

**Total P0 Effort**: 22-28 hours (matches Week 5 capacity of 25-30 hours)

**P1 Effort** (optional Friday):
- UC-007 (Metrics): 2,200-2,800 words, 11-13 ACs, 16-20 test cases, 4-5 NFRs → 4-5 hours
- UC-010 (Rollback): 2,300-2,800 words, 11-13 ACs, 17-20 test cases, 4-5 NFRs → 4-5 hours

**Total P1 Effort**: 8-10 hours (defer to Construction Week 1 if Week 5 time-constrained)

### 5.2 Week 5 Timeline

**Day-by-Day Schedule** (assuming 25-30 productive hours):

| Day | Use Case | Effort | Cumulative | Deliverable |
|-----|----------|--------|-----------|------------|
| **Monday** | UC-006 (Traceability) | 8-10 hours | 8-10 hours | 3,000-3,500 words, 14-16 ACs, 22-25 test cases |
| **Tuesday** | UC-011 (Security) | 6-8 hours | 14-18 hours | 2,800-3,200 words, 13-15 ACs, 20-24 test cases |
| **Wednesday** | UC-009 (Test Templates) | 5-6 hours | 19-24 hours | 2,500-3,000 words, 12-14 ACs, 18-22 test cases |

| **Friday** | UC-007 (Metrics - P1) OR Buffer | 4-5 hours (optional) | 26-33 hours | Optional: 2,200-2,800 words, 11-13 ACs, 16-20 test cases |

**Cumulative Deliverable (P0 UCs)**: ~10,300-12,200 words, 49-57 ACs, 75-89 test cases, 19-26 NFRs

### 5.3 Risk Mitigation

**RISK: UC-006 Complexity Overrun**:
- **Likelihood**: MEDIUM (HIGH complexity, graph algorithms)
- **Impact**: HIGH (delays entire Week 5 schedule)
- **Mitigation**:
  - Start Monday with full day available (8-10 hours)
  - Build 2-hour buffer into estimate
  - If overruns, compress UC-008 (LOW complexity) to 2.5 hours
- **Contingency**: Use Friday as buffer (defer UC-007 to Construction Week 1)

**RISK: Time-Constrained Week 5**:
- **Likelihood**: LOW (25-30 hours realistic for Requirements Analyst)
- **Impact**: MEDIUM (UC-007 deferred to Construction)
- **Mitigation**:
  - Prioritize P0 UCs first (UC-006, UC-011, UC-009, UC-008)
  - UC-007 (P1) optional Friday work
  - UC-010 (P1) deferred regardless
- **Contingency**: All P0 UCs complete by Thursday (22-28 hours)

---

## 7. Recommendation Summary

### 7.1 Primary Recommendation

**Elaborate 4 P0 use cases in Elaboration Week 5** (UC-006, UC-008, UC-009, UC-011):

1. **UC-006 (Traceability Automation)** - Monday (8-10 hours)
   - **Priority**: FIRST (highest complexity, enterprise blocker)
   - **Deliverable**: 3,000-3,500 words, 14-16 ACs, 22-25 test cases, 6-8 NFRs

2. **UC-011 (Security Validation)** - Tuesday (6-8 hours)
   - **Priority**: SECOND (security gate for deployment, attack detection)
   - **Deliverable**: 2,800-3,200 words, 13-15 ACs, 20-24 test cases, 5-7 NFRs

3. **UC-009 (Test Templates)** - Wednesday (5-6 hours)
   - **Priority**: THIRD (quality gate for Construction, orchestration)
   - **Deliverable**: 2,500-3,000 words, 12-14 ACs, 18-22 test cases, 5-7 NFRs

4. **UC-008 (Template Selection)** - Thursday (3-4 hours)
   - **Priority**: FOURTH (onboarding experience, quick win)
   - **Deliverable**: 2,000-2,500 words, 10-12 ACs, 15-18 test cases, 3-4 NFRs

**Total Effort**: 22-28 hours (matches Week 5 capacity of 25-30 hours)

### 7.2 Secondary Recommendation (Optional Friday)

**If all P0 UCs complete by Thursday**: Add UC-007 (Metrics - P1) on Friday (4-5 hours)

**Deliverable**: 2,200-2,800 words, 11-13 ACs, 16-20 test cases, 4-5 NFRs

**Benefit**: Reduces Construction Week 1 workload (UC-007 + UC-010 from 8-10 hours to 4-5 hours)

**Risk**: If UC-006 overran, Friday needed as buffer for P0 UCs

### 7.3 P1 Deferral Strategy

**Defer UC-007 (Metrics) and UC-010 (Rollback) to Construction Week 1**:

**Manual Workarounds** (MVP acceptable):
- **UC-007**: Users inspect `.aiwg/reports/` for metrics (velocity, test coverage, story points)
- **UC-010**: Users rollback via `git reset --hard <commit>` + `aiwg -uninstall`

**Version 1.1 Enhancement** (3 months post-MVP):
- **UC-007**: Automated metrics collection, historical trends, real-time dashboards
- **UC-010**: Automated rollback (<5s), data integrity validation, orphan cleanup

**User Impact**: LOW (early adopters tolerate manual workarounds)

### 7.4 Construction Phase Transition

**By End of Week 5**:
- ✅ 6/11 use cases fully elaborated (54% ready) - UC-001, UC-005, UC-006, UC-008, UC-009, UC-011
- ✅ All P0 features baselined for Construction (FID-000, FID-001, FID-003, FID-004, FID-006)
- ✅ P0 NFRs identified (18-24 NFRs) and measurable
- ✅ Test infrastructure blockers resolved (BLOCKER-001, BLOCKER-002)
- ✅ Critical path validated (deployment → security → traceability → templates → testing → meta-application)

**Construction Week 1 Activities**:
- Expand UC-002, UC-003, UC-004 (parallel to feature implementation)
- Elaborate UC-007, UC-010 (P1 use cases)
- Resolve BLOCKER-003 (test data catalog)
- Begin P0 feature implementation (FID-000, FID-001, FID-003, FID-004, FID-006)

**Go/No-Go Decision**: ✅ GO for Construction Phase (all P0 requirements baselined)
