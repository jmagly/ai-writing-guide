| UC-003 | 1,342 words | BASIC STRUCTURE | HIGH (critical brownfield support) |
| UC-004 | 2,178 words | MODERATE DETAIL | MEDIUM (expand test scenarios) |
| UC-005 | 8,542 words | **FULLY ELABORATED (Week 5)** | **COMPLETE** |
| UC-006 | 9,247 words | **FULLY ELABORATED (Week 5)** | **COMPLETE** |

**Gaps Identified (Initial - Week 4):**

1. **UC-005 through UC-011**: Missing main success scenarios (placeholders only) → **RESOLVED (5 of 7 completed in Week 5)**
2. **UC-003, UC-004**: Insufficient alternate flows (2 vs target 2-5) → **PENDING**
3. **UC-002 through UC-011**: Missing exception flows (need 3-7 per use case) → **PARTIALLY RESOLVED**
4. **UC-002 through UC-011**: Minimal acceptance criteria (1-4 vs target 10-20) → **PARTIALLY RESOLVED**
5. **UC-002 through UC-011**: No test case specifications (need 15-30 per use case) → **PARTIALLY RESOLVED**
6. **All (except UC-001)**: Missing detailed data validation rules → **IN PROGRESS**
7. **All (except UC-001)**: Insufficient traceability to NFRs → **IN PROGRESS**

### 2. Elaboration Plan

**Systematic Approach:**

For each use case (UC-002 through UC-011):

**Phase A: Main Success Scenario (8-15 steps)**
- Detailed step-by-step flow (numbered steps)
- Actor actions and system responses
- Specific inputs, outputs, state changes
- Complete end-to-end happy path

**Phase B: Alternate Flows (2-5 per use case)**
- Common variations (different user roles, optional steps)
- Decision points and branch conditions
- Alternate paths with clear resume points
- Link back to main scenario steps

**Phase C: Exception Flows (3-7 per use case)**
- Error scenarios (invalid input, system failures, timeouts)
- Recovery procedures
- Specific error messages and user guidance
- Graceful degradation paths

**Phase D: Acceptance Criteria (10-20 per use case)**
- Given/When/Then format (Gherkin)
- Testable, measurable outcomes
- Cover main flow + alternates + exceptions
- Include NFR validation

**Phase E: Test Cases (15-30 per use case)**
- Test case IDs (TC-{UC-ID}-{seq})
- Map to acceptance criteria
- Specify test data needs
- Include positive and negative tests

## Workshop Notes

**Reference Standard (UC-001):**

UC-001 demonstrates target quality:
- **Main Scenario**: 14 detailed steps with specific inputs/outputs
- **Alternate Flows**: 4 comprehensive flows (domain-specific validation, false positives, iterative improvement, batch validation)
- **Exception Flows**: 4 robust flows (timeout, database inaccessible, permission denied, agent missing)
- **Acceptance Criteria**: 8 comprehensive criteria covering main flow + alternates + exceptions
- **NFR Integration**: 9 NFRs specified with clear rationale
- **Business Rules**: 3 rules with specific thresholds and policies
- **Data Requirements**: Detailed input/output specifications with validation rules

**Lessons Learned (Applied to UC-002 through UC-011):**

1. **Concrete Examples**: Use specific file paths, line numbers, metrics (e.g., "3,245 words", "15 formulaic phrases")
2. **Measurable Outcomes**: Quantify success (e.g., "80-90% field accuracy", "100% requirements coverage")
3. **Error Messages**: Specify exact error text and remediation steps
4. **Resume Points**: Clearly mark where alternate/exception flows rejoin main flow
5. **Actor Goals**: Document user motivations and pain points
6. **Real-World Context**: Include domain knowledge (e.g., "HIPAA compliance", "SOC2 audit")
