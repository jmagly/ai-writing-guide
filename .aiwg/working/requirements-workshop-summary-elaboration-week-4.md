## Workshop Metadata

- **Date**: 2025-10-19
- **Facilitator**: System Analyst (Requirements Analyst agent)
- **Objective**: Elaborate UC-001 through UC-011 with complete scenarios, acceptance criteria, and test cases
- **Target Quality**: 2,000-4,000 words per use case, 10-20 acceptance criteria, 15-30 test cases

## Workshop Agenda Executed

### 1. Review Existing Use Cases (Completed)

**Status Assessment:**

| Use Case | Current Word Count | Status | Priority for Elaboration |
|----------|-------------------|--------|-------------------------|
| UC-001 | 4,287 words | FULLY ELABORATED | COMPLETE (reference standard) |
| UC-002 | 2,456 words | PARTIALLY ELABORATED | MEDIUM (expand exception flows) |
| UC-003 | 1,342 words | BASIC STRUCTURE | HIGH (critical brownfield support) |
| UC-004 | 2,178 words | MODERATE DETAIL | MEDIUM (expand test scenarios) |
| UC-005 | 93 words | MINIMAL PLACEHOLDER | CRITICAL (meta-application) |
| UC-006 | 94 words | MINIMAL PLACEHOLDER | CRITICAL (traceability) |
| UC-007 | 94 words | MINIMAL PLACEHOLDER | CRITICAL (metrics) |
| UC-008 | 94 words | MINIMAL PLACEHOLDER | CRITICAL (template selection) |
| UC-009 | 95 words | MINIMAL PLACEHOLDER | CRITICAL (test generation) |
| UC-010 | 95 words | MINIMAL PLACEHOLDER | CRITICAL (rollback) |
| UC-011 | 95 words | MINIMAL PLACEHOLDER | CRITICAL (security validation) |

**Gaps Identified:**

1. **UC-005 through UC-011**: Missing main success scenarios (placeholders only)
2. **UC-003, UC-004**: Insufficient alternate flows (2 vs target 2-5)
3. **UC-002 through UC-011**: Missing exception flows (need 3-7 per use case)
4. **UC-002 through UC-011**: Minimal acceptance criteria (1-4 vs target 10-20)
5. **UC-002 through UC-011**: No test case specifications (need 15-30 per use case)
6. **All (except UC-001)**: Missing detailed data validation rules
7. **All (except UC-001)**: Insufficient traceability to NFRs

### 2. Elaboration Plan

**Systematic Approach:**

For each use case (UC-002 through UC-011):

**Phase A: Main Success Scenario (8-15 steps)**
- Detailed step-by-step flow (numbered steps)
- Actor actions and system responses
- Specific inputs, outputs, state changes
- Complete end-to-end happy path

**Phase B: Alternate Flows (2-5 per use case)**
- Common variations (different user roles, optional steps)
- Decision points and branch conditions
- Alternate paths with clear resume points
- Link back to main scenario steps

**Phase C: Exception Flows (3-7 per use case)**
- Error scenarios (invalid input, system failures, timeouts)
- Recovery procedures
- Specific error messages and user guidance
- Graceful degradation paths

**Phase D: Acceptance Criteria (10-20 per use case)**
- Given/When/Then format (Gherkin)
- Testable, measurable outcomes
- Cover main flow + alternates + exceptions
- Include NFR validation

**Phase E: Test Cases (15-30 per use case)**
- Test case IDs (TC-{UC-ID}-{seq})
- Map to acceptance criteria
- Specify test data needs
- Include positive and negative tests

2. **Measurable Outcomes**: Quantify success (e.g., "80-90% field accuracy", "100% requirements coverage")
3. **Error Messages**: Specify exact error text and remediation steps
4. **Resume Points**: Clearly mark where alternate/exception flows rejoin main flow
5. **Actor Goals**: Document user motivations and pain points
6. **Real-World Context**: Include domain knowledge (e.g., "HIPAA compliance", "SOC2 audit")
