## Executive Summary

This matrix maps all 11 use cases (UC-001 through UC-011) to prioritized features (FID-001 through FID-024) and recommends elaboration order for Elaboration Week 5-6 based on:

1. **Product Strategist P0 Feature Recommendation** (5 features: FID-001, FID-003, FID-004, FID-006, FID-007)
2. **Feature Backlog Prioritization** (7 P0 features with FID-007 as critical blocker)
3. **Use Case Complexity and NFR Count**
4. **Critical Path Dependencies**

**Key Findings**:

- **UC-005 (Framework Self-Improvement)** is the only FULLY ELABORATED use case (8,542 words) - serves as quality standard
- **UC-006 through UC-011** are minimal placeholders (94-95 words each) requiring full elaboration
- **P0 Use Cases**: UC-001, UC-002, UC-003, UC-004, UC-006, UC-008, UC-009, UC-011 (8 use cases map to P0 features)
- **P1 Use Cases**: UC-005 (meta-application), UC-007 (metrics), UC-010 (rollback)
- **Total P0 Elaboration Effort**: 194 hours (4.85 weeks @ 40hr/week)

**CRITICAL RECOMMENDATION**: Defer UC-005 elaboration to Construction Week 1 (already fully elaborated at 8,542 words). Focus Elaboration Week 5-6 on UC-006, UC-008, UC-009, UC-011 (P0 features).

## Section 1: Use Case to Feature Mapping

### 1.1 Complete Mapping Matrix

| UC ID | Use Case Name | Feature ID(s) | Feature Name | Priority | Complexity | NFR Count | Effort (hrs) |
|-------|---------------|--------------|--------------|----------|------------|-----------|--------------|
| UC-001 | Validate AI-Generated Content | FID-000 (REQ-WR-001) | AI Pattern Detection, Writing Validation | **P0** | High | 9 | COMPLETE (4,287 words) |
| UC-002 | Deploy SDLC Framework | FID-001, FID-007 | Agent Deployment, Workspace Management | **P0** | High | 8 | 20 (expand from 2,456 words) |
| UC-003 | Analyze Existing Codebase for Intake | FID-003 (REQ-SDLC-003) | Brownfield Support, Intake Generation | **P0** | Medium | 6 | 30 (expand from 1,342 words) |
| UC-004 | Multi-Agent Workflows | FID-004 (REQ-SDLC-005) | Multi-Agent Orchestration | **P0** | High | 8 | 25 (expand from 2,178 words) |
| UC-005 | Framework Self-Improvement | FID-000 (Meta-Application) | Self-Application, Dogfooding | **P1** | Very High | 8 | COMPLETE (8,542 words) |
| UC-006 | Automated Traceability Validation | FID-001 | Traceability Automation | **P0** | High | 8 | 40 |
| UC-007 | Collect and Visualize Metrics | FID-002 | Metrics Collection | **P1** | Medium | 6 | 35 |
| UC-008 | Template Selection Guides | FID-003 | Template Selection | **P0** | Medium | 5 | 28 |
| UC-009 | Generate Test Templates | FID-004 | Test Templates | **P0** | High | 7 | 40 |
| UC-010 | Plugin Rollback | FID-005 | Rollback Implementation | **P1** | Medium | 5 | 16 |
| UC-011 | Validate Plugin Security | FID-006 | Security Phase 1-2 | **P0** | High | 6 | 40 |

**Priority Legend**:
- **P0 (Critical - MVP)**: FID-001, FID-003, FID-004, FID-006, FID-007 (5 features per Product Strategist)
- **P1 (High Value - v1.1)**: FID-000 (Meta-Application), FID-002 (Metrics), FID-005 (Rollback)
- **P2 (Deferred - v2.0+)**: FID-008 through FID-024 (marketplace, research, multi-platform, etc.)

### 1.2 Rationale for UC-005 Priority Change

**Product Strategist Recommendation** (Product Strategist Review lines 38-52):
- **Keep P0**: FID-000 (Meta-Application), FID-001, FID-003, FID-004, FID-006
- **Defer to P1**: FID-002 (Metrics), FID-005 (Rollback)

**However, Feature Backlog Prioritized v1.1** reclassified features:
- **FID-000** (Meta-Application) was absorbed into UC-005 context, not listed as separate FID
- **UC-005** already fully elaborated (8,542 words) - no additional elaboration needed in Week 5
- **Recommendation**: Classify UC-005 as **P1 for elaboration purposes** (defer expansion to Construction Week 1) since UC-005 already meets quality standards

**Impact**: This frees up ~20 hours in Elaboration Week 5-6 to focus on UC-006, UC-008, UC-009, UC-011 elaboration

### 1.3 Use Case Dependency Graph

**Critical Path Dependencies**:

```
UC-002 (Deploy SDLC Framework)
  └─> UC-003 (Intake from Codebase)
      └─> UC-004 (Multi-Agent Workflows)
          └─> UC-009 (Test Templates)
  └─> UC-011 (Security Validation) [gates deployment]

UC-006 (Traceability Automation)
  └─> UC-007 (Metrics Collection) [traceability data feeds metrics]

UC-008 (Template Selection)
  └─> UC-009 (Test Templates) [template selection drives deployment]

UC-010 (Rollback)
  └─> UC-002, UC-011 [rollback supports deployment and security]
```

**Elaboration Order Constraints**:
1. **UC-002** must elaborate before UC-003, UC-004 (deployment prerequisites)
2. **UC-006** should elaborate before UC-007 (metrics depends on traceability data)
3. **UC-008** should elaborate before UC-009 (template selection drives test deployment)
4. **UC-011** should elaborate in parallel with UC-002 (security gates deployment)

## Section 3: P1 Use Cases (v1.1 - Defer)

**Total P1 Use Cases**: 3 (UC-005, UC-007, UC-010)

### 3.1 P1 Use Case Details

#### UC-005: Framework Self-Improvement (Meta-Application)
- **Feature**: FID-000 (Meta-Application)
- **Status**: ✅ FULLY ELABORATED (8,542 words)
- **Complexity**: Very High
- **NFR Count**: 8
- **Effort**: COMPLETE (no additional elaboration needed)
- **Priority**: **DEFER to Construction Week 1** (already meets quality standards)

**Rationale for Deferral**:
- UC-005 already 8,542 words (exceeds 2,000-4,000 word target by 2.1x)
- 12 acceptance criteria (meets 10-20 target)
- 30 test cases (meets 15-30 target)
- 8 NFRs fully specified
- **Product Strategist recommendation**: Meta-application (FID-000) is P0, but UC-005 elaboration already complete
- **Conclusion**: No additional elaboration work needed in Elaboration Week 5 - defer minor enhancements (business outcome metrics) to Construction Week 1

---

#### UC-007: Collect and Visualize Metrics
- **Feature**: FID-002 - Metrics Collection
- **Status**: ❌ MINIMAL PLACEHOLDER (94 words)
- **Complexity**: Medium
- **NFR Count**: 6
- **Effort**: 35 hours (create 2,500-3,000 words)
- **Priority**: **DEFER to Construction Week 1**

**Rationale for Deferral**:
- **Product Strategist recommendation**: FID-002 (Metrics) deferred to P1 (not critical for MVP)
- **Dependency**: Requires FID-007 (Workspace Management) + FID-001 (Traceability) to aggregate metrics
- **Manual workaround acceptable**: Users inspect `.aiwg/reports/` artifacts manually for MVP
- **Target elaboration**: Construction Week 1 (parallel to feature implementation)

---

#### UC-010: Plugin Rollback
- **Feature**: FID-005 - Rollback Implementation
- **Status**: ❌ MINIMAL PLACEHOLDER (95 words)
- **Complexity**: Medium
- **NFR Count**: 5
- **Effort**: 16 hours (create 2,000-2,500 words)
- **Priority**: **DEFER to Construction Week 1**

**Rationale for Deferral**:
- **Product Strategist recommendation**: FID-005 (Rollback) deferred to P1 (not critical for MVP)
- **Manual workaround acceptable**: Users rollback via `git reset --hard` or `aiwg -uninstall`
- **Low complexity**: 16 hours effort, can elaborate quickly in Construction Week 1
- **Target elaboration**: Construction Week 1-2 (parallel to rollback implementation)

---

### 3.2 P1 Elaboration Effort Summary

| UC ID | Use Case Name | Complexity | NFR Count | Effort (hrs) | Target Phase |

**Timeline**: Construction Week 1-2 (parallel to P1 feature implementation)

---

## Section 4: P2 Use Cases (v2.0+ - No Elaboration Planned)

**No P2 Use Cases Defined** (UC-001 through UC-011 all map to P0 or P1 features)

**Future Use Cases** (if created):
- UC-012: Framework-Aware Workspace Management (maps to FID-007, but FID-007 is P0)
- UC-013+: Advanced features (marketplace, multi-platform, research flows, etc.)

---

## Section 5: Elaboration Priority Order (Week 5-6)

### 5.1 Recommended Elaboration Sequence

**Critical Path Rationale**:
1. **UC-006 first**: Traceability is foundation for metrics (UC-007 depends on UC-006 data)
2. **UC-002 + UC-011 parallel**: Security gates deployment, both high priority
3. **UC-008 before UC-009**: Template selection drives test template deployment
4. **UC-003, UC-004 after foundations**: Expand partially elaborated use cases

## Section 6: Elaboration Success Criteria

### 6.1 Use Case Quality Standards

**Per Use Case Targets** (based on UC-001 and UC-005 quality standards):

| Metric | Target | UC-001 Actual | UC-005 Actual |
|--------|--------|---------------|---------------|
| Word Count | 2,000-4,000 words | 4,287 words ✅ | 8,542 words ✅ |
| Main Scenario Steps | 8-15 steps | 14 steps ✅ | 16 steps ✅ |
| Alternate Flows | 2-5 flows | 4 flows ✅ | 4 flows ✅ |
| Exception Flows | 3-7 flows | 4 flows ✅ | 6 flows ✅ |
| Acceptance Criteria | 10-20 criteria | 8 criteria ⚠️ | 12 criteria ✅ |
| Test Cases | 15-30 cases | 18 cases ✅ | 30 cases ✅ |
| NFRs Specified | 5-10 NFRs | 9 NFRs ✅ | 8 NFRs ✅ |

**Quality Gates**:
- ✅ All P0 use cases (UC-002, UC-003, UC-004, UC-006, UC-008, UC-009, UC-011) elaborated to 2,000+ words
- ✅ Acceptance criteria: 10-20 per use case (Given/When/Then format)
- ✅ Test cases: 15-30 per use case (mapped to acceptance criteria)
- ✅ NFRs: 5-10 NFRs per use case (traceability to Supplemental Specification)
- ✅ Traceability: 100% coverage (use cases → components → test cases)

### 6.2 Elaboration Completion Criteria

**Gate Criteria for Elaboration → Construction Transition**:

| Criterion | Target | Status |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| P0 Use Cases Elaborated | 8/8 (UC-001, UC-002, UC-003, UC-004, UC-006, UC-008, UC-009, UC-011) | IN PROGRESS (1/8 complete) |
| P1 Use Cases Elaborated | 0/3 (defer to Construction) | DEFERRED |
| Total Word Count | 24,000-32,000 words (8 use cases × 3,000-4,000 avg) | 9,663 words (40% complete) |
| Acceptance Criteria | 80-160 criteria (8 use cases × 10-20 avg) | 15 criteria (9% complete) |
| Test Cases | 120-240 cases (8 use cases × 15-30 avg) | 18 cases (8% complete) |
| NFRs Extracted | 48 NFRs (already complete) | ✅ COMPLETE (48/48) |
| Traceability Coverage | 100% (all requirements mapped) | ✅ COMPLETE (58/58 requirements) |

**Blocker Resolution** (from Requirements Status Report):
- ❌ BLOCKER-001: Test Infrastructure Specification (defer to Construction Week 1)
- ❌ BLOCKER-002: NFR Measurement Methodology (complete in Elaboration Week 5)
- ❌ BLOCKER-003: Test Data Catalog (defer to Construction Week 1)

**Recommendation**: Resolve BLOCKER-002 (NFR measurement) in parallel with UC-006 elaboration (Week 5). Defer BLOCKER-001 and BLOCKER-003 to Construction Week 1 (not blocking requirements elaboration).

## Section 8: Risk Assessment

### 8.1 Elaboration Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| **Elaboration timeline exceeds 4 weeks (Week 5-8)** | High | Medium | Prioritize UC-006, UC-002, UC-011 (critical path), defer UC-009 if time-constrained |
| **UC-006 complexity exceeds 40 hour estimate** | Medium | High | 8-hour PoC spike (graph generation, orphan detection) to validate estimate |
| **UC-011 security requirements evolve** | Medium | Medium | Lock scope to Phase 1-2 (YAML parsing, path sanitization, dependency verification) |
| **Review cycles extend timeline by 1-2 weeks** | Medium | Medium | Budget 2 weeks (Week 9-10) for multi-agent reviews and revisions |
| **Acceptance criteria lack business outcome metrics** | High | Low | Apply Product Strategist feedback pattern (add productivity, velocity, quality metrics to all ACs) |

### 8.2 Construction Readiness Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| **Test infrastructure blocker (BLOCKER-001) delays Construction** | Medium | High | Defer blocker resolution to Construction Week 1 (not blocking requirements) |
| **P0 use cases incomplete by Elaboration Week 8** | Medium | High | Strict prioritization (defer UC-009 if capacity constrained) |
| **P1 use cases elaboration delayed** | Low | Low | P1 elaboration in Construction Week 1 (parallel to implementation) |
