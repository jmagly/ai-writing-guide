---

```yaml
document: Use Case Priority Matrix
iteration: Elaboration Week 5
version: 2.0
status: FINAL
created: 2025-10-22
updated: 2025-10-22 (Product Strategist P0 feature alignment)
project: AI Writing Guide - SDLC Framework
phase: Elaboration
purpose: Identify P0 use cases for Week 5 elaboration based on Product Strategist feature prioritization
```

---

## Executive Summary

**Objective**: Map use cases UC-001 through UC-011 to feature IDs (FID-*), apply P0/P1/P2 prioritization based on Product Strategist recommendations, and identify which use cases to elaborate in Elaboration Week 5.

**Product Strategist P0 Features** (5 features for MVP):
- **FID-000**: Meta-Application (Framework Self-Improvement) - UNIQUE DIFFERENTIATOR
- **FID-001**: Traceability Automation - ENTERPRISE ADOPTION CRITICAL
- **FID-003**: Template Selection Guides - ONBOARDING FRICTION REDUCTION
- **FID-004**: Test Templates - QUALITY ENABLER
- **FID-006**: Security Phase 1-2 (Plugin Validation) - ENTERPRISE BLOCKER IF MISSING

**Deferred to P1** (Version 1.1 - 3 months post-MVP):
- **FID-002**: Metrics Collection - NICE-TO-HAVE (manual workaround via logs/reports)
- **FID-005**: Plugin Rollback - NICE-TO-HAVE (manual workaround via git reset)

**Key Finding**: 4 P0 use cases (UC-006, UC-008, UC-009, UC-011) require full elaboration in Week 5 to support P0 features for Construction phase readiness.

**Week 5 Deliverable**: ~10,300-12,200 words, 49-57 ACs, 75-89 test cases, 19-26 NFRs (22-28 hours estimated effort)

- **Total Word Count**: ~19,090 words (target: 30,000-35,000 words for all 11 use cases)

### 1.2 Use Case Creation Status

**Existing Files** (all 11 use cases have files created):
- ✅ UC-001 through UC-005: Substantive content (1,342 to 8,542 words)
- ✅ UC-006 through UC-011: Placeholder structures (94-95 words each)

**Template Structures Present**:
- All use cases have basic metadata, sections 1-12 defined
- UC-006 through UC-011 have placeholders in Main Success Scenario, Alternate Flows, Exception Flows, Acceptance Criteria
- All use cases have NFR specifications (1-3 NFRs per UC), but need expansion

**No use cases need creation from scratch** - all require elaboration/expansion of existing structures.

## 2. Use Case to Feature Mapping

### 2.1 Direct UC → FID Mapping

| Use Case | Feature ID(s) | Feature Name | Backlog Reference |
|----------|--------------|--------------|-------------------|
| UC-001 | REQ-WR-001, REQ-WR-002 | AI Pattern Detection, Writing Validation | Product Backlog (Writing Guide) |
| UC-002 | REQ-SDLC-001, REQ-SDLC-002 | Agent Deployment, Project Setup | Product Backlog (SDLC Framework) |
| UC-003 | REQ-SDLC-003, REQ-SDLC-004 | Brownfield Support, Intake Generation | Product Backlog (SDLC Framework) |
| UC-004 | REQ-SDLC-005, REQ-SDLC-006 | Multi-Agent Orchestration | Product Backlog (SDLC Framework) |

### 2.2 Cross-Use-Case Dependencies

**Dependency Graph**:

```
UC-002 (Deploy SDLC Framework)
  ↓ (must complete before)
  ├── UC-003 (Intake from Codebase) - requires agents deployed
  ├── UC-004 (Multi-Agent Orchestration) - requires agents deployed
  └── UC-011 (Security Validation) - security gates deployment

UC-003 (Intake from Codebase)
  ↓ (enables)
  └── UC-005 (Framework Self-Improvement) - intake enables meta-application

UC-004 (Multi-Agent Orchestration)
  ↓ (required for)
  └── UC-009 (Test Artifact Generation) - multi-agent workflow for test docs

UC-006 (Traceability Automation)
  ↓ (feeds data to)
  └── UC-007 (Metrics Collection) - traceability metrics drive velocity tracking

UC-008 (Template Selection)
  ↓ (drives)
  └── UC-009 (Test Template Generation) - selected templates deployed

UC-010 (Plugin Rollback)
  ↓ (supports)
  ├── UC-002 (Deployment) - rollback failed deployments
  └── UC-011 (Security Validation) - rollback failed security checks
```

**Critical Path for MVP**:
1. **UC-002** (Deploy SDLC Framework) → Foundation for all other UCs
2. **UC-011** (Security Validation) → Gates UC-002 deployment
3. **UC-008** (Template Selection) → Onboarding experience
4. **UC-006** (Traceability Automation) → Enterprise compliance
5. **UC-009** (Test Templates) → Quality assurance
6. **UC-005** (Framework Self-Improvement) → Differentiation (can start after UC-002)

## 3. P0/P1/P2 Prioritization

### 3.1 P0 Use Cases (Must Elaborate for MVP)

**Criteria**: Maps to P0 features (FID-000, FID-001, FID-003, FID-004, FID-006) identified by Product Strategist

| Use Case | Feature ID | Business Impact | MVP Blocker? | Elaboration Status |
|----------|-----------|-----------------|--------------|-------------------|
| **UC-005** | **FID-000** | **Unique differentiator, trust builder** | **YES - Credibility** | ✅ COMPLETE (8,542 words) |
| **UC-006** | **FID-001** | **Enterprise adoption, compliance proof** | **YES - Enterprise blocker** | ❌ PLACEHOLDER (94 words) |
| **UC-008** | **FID-003** | **Onboarding friction reduction** | **YES - Adoption barrier** | ❌ PLACEHOLDER (94 words) |
| **UC-009** | **FID-004** | **Quality enabler, testing productivity** | **YES - Quality gate** | ❌ PLACEHOLDER (95 words) |
| **UC-011** | **FID-006** | **Security table stakes, enterprise blocker** | **YES - Security gate** | ❌ PLACEHOLDER (95 words) |

**P0 Use Cases Requiring Elaboration**: 4 use cases (UC-006, UC-008, UC-009, UC-011)

**Why P0?**:
- **UC-006 (Traceability)**: Enterprise adoption blocker - regulated industries require 100% requirements-to-code traceability for compliance (SOC2, FDA, ISO)
- **UC-008 (Template Selection)**: Onboarding conversion rate - 50% time reduction target makes framework accessible to solo developers (not just enterprises)
- **UC-009 (Test Templates)**: Quality assurance - reduces manual test writing burden, enables 80%/70%/50% coverage targets (unit/integration/E2E)
- **UC-011 (Security Validation)**: Security table stakes - prevents malicious plugins, builds trust for enterprise adoption

### 3.2 P1 Use Cases (Defer to Version 1.1)

**Criteria**: Maps to P1 features (FID-002, FID-005) deferred by Product Strategist

| Use Case | Feature ID | Business Impact | Deferral Rationale | Manual Workaround |
|----------|-----------|-----------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **UC-007** | **FID-002** | **Observability feature, data-driven improvement** | **Metrics nice-to-have, not core value** | Manual metrics via `.aiwg/reports/` artifacts |
| **UC-010** | **FID-005** | **Risk mitigation, trust builder** | **Rollback rarely needed pre-production** | Manual rollback via `git reset --hard` |

**P1 Use Cases for Construction Week 1**: 2 use cases (UC-007, UC-010)

**Why P1 (not P0)?**:
- **UC-007 (Metrics)**: Observability enhances framework but isn't a blocker - early adopters accept manual inspection of artifacts
- **UC-010 (Rollback)**: Safety net for failed installations, but git-based workaround acceptable for MVP (commit before install, reset on failure)

### 3.3 P2 Use Cases (Already Elaborated or Not in FID Scope)

**Criteria**: Partially elaborated use cases supporting P0 features (not explicitly FID-mapped, but foundational)

| Use Case | Current Status | Priority Rationale | Elaboration Strategy |
|----------|---------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **UC-001** | ✅ FULLY ELABORATED (4,287 words) | Foundation for AI validation (core product) | COMPLETE - Reference standard |
| **UC-002** | ⚠️ PARTIALLY ELABORATED (2,456 words) | Foundation for deployment (enables all UCs) | Expand in Construction Week 1 (parallel to feature impl) |
| **UC-003** | ⚠️ BASIC STRUCTURE (1,342 words) | Brownfield support (critical for enterprise) | Expand in Construction Week 2 (parallel to intake features) |
| **UC-004** | ⚠️ MODERATE DETAIL (2,178 words) | Multi-agent orchestration (enables UC-009) | Expand in Construction Week 1 (parallel to orchestration impl) |

**Why Defer UC-002, UC-003, UC-004 Expansion?**:
- Basic structures exist (1,342-2,456 words) - sufficient for Construction start
- Expansion can occur in parallel with feature implementation (Construction Weeks 1-2)
- Developers implementing features will identify missing scenarios (just-in-time elaboration)

## 4. Complexity Assessment

### 4.1 Elaboration Complexity Scoring

**Complexity Factors**:
1. **Workflow Complexity**: Simple linear flow (Low) vs branching/parallel flows (High)
2. **NFR Count**: 1-3 NFRs (Low) vs 5-10+ NFRs (High)
3. **Integration Touchpoints**: Isolated feature (Low) vs multi-component orchestration (High)
4. **Test Scenarios**: 10-15 test cases (Low) vs 25-30+ test cases (High)
5. **Alternate/Exception Flows**: 2-3 flows (Low) vs 5-8+ flows (High)

**Complexity Matrix**:

| Use Case | Workflow | NFR Count | Integration | Test Scenarios | Flows | Overall Complexity |
|----------|----------|-----------|-------------|----------------|-------|-------------------|
| UC-006 (Traceability) | MEDIUM | HIGH (5-8) | HIGH (graph algorithms, metadata parsers) | MEDIUM (20) | MEDIUM (3-4) | **HIGH** |
| UC-008 (Template Selection) | LOW | LOW (3) | LOW (template library lookup) | LOW (15) | LOW (2-3) | **LOW** |
| UC-009 (Test Templates) | MEDIUM | MEDIUM (4-6) | MEDIUM (multi-agent orchestration) | MEDIUM (18) | MEDIUM (3-4) | **MEDIUM** |
| UC-011 (Security Validation) | MEDIUM | MEDIUM (4-6) | MEDIUM (validators, user approval) | MEDIUM (18) | HIGH (5-6) | **MEDIUM-HIGH** |

**Complexity Ranking** (High → Low):
1. **UC-006** (Traceability) - HIGH complexity (graph algorithms, 10,000+ node performance, orphan detection)
2. **UC-011** (Security Validation) - MEDIUM-HIGH complexity (attack detection, user approval workflow, dependency verification)
3. **UC-009** (Test Templates) - MEDIUM complexity (multi-agent orchestration, test suite comprehensiveness)
4. **UC-008** (Template Selection) - LOW complexity (project type detection, template pack recommendation)

### 4.2 Estimated NFR Count per Use Case

**NFR Estimation Methodology**: Based on UC-005 (8 NFRs for 16-step workflow) and requirements workshop pattern (48 NFRs for 11 UCs = ~4.4 NFRs/UC average)

| Use Case | Primary NFR Categories | Estimated NFR Count | Rationale |
|----------|----------------------|---------------------|-----------|
| **UC-006** | Performance, Accuracy, Completeness, Scalability | **6-8 NFRs** | Traceability validation time (<90s), accuracy (99%), orphan detection (100%), max node count (10k+), memory efficiency |
| **UC-008** | Performance, Usability, Accuracy | **3-4 NFRs** | Template selection time (<2 min), onboarding time reduction (50%), recommendation acceptance (85%), first-time user experience |
| **UC-009** | Performance, Quality, Completeness, Usability | **5-7 NFRs** | Test suite generation time (<10 min), coverage targets (80%/70%/50%), template completeness (all test types), clarity for developers |
| **UC-011** | Security, Performance, Accuracy, Usability | **5-7 NFRs** | Validation time (<10s), attack detection (100% known vectors), false positives (<5%), user approval clarity, dependency integrity (SHA-256) |

**Total Estimated NFRs for P0 UCs**: 19-26 NFRs (in addition to 48 existing NFRs from requirements workshop)

### 4.3 Elaboration Effort Estimates

**Estimation Assumptions**:
- **Low Complexity**: 3-4 hours (simple workflow, 2,000-2,500 words, 10-12 ACs, 15-18 test cases)
- **Medium Complexity**: 5-6 hours (moderate workflow, 2,500-3,000 words, 12-15 ACs, 18-22 test cases)
- **High Complexity**: 8-10 hours (complex workflow, 3,000-4,000 words, 15-18 ACs, 22-30 test cases)

**Reference Baseline**: UC-005 (8,542 words, 12 ACs, 30 test cases) took ~10-12 hours (HIGH complexity)

| Use Case | Complexity | Target Word Count | Target ACs | Target Test Cases | Estimated Effort (Hours) |
|----------|-----------|------------------|-----------|------------------|-------------------------|
| **UC-006** | HIGH | 3,000-3,500 words | 14-16 ACs | 22-25 test cases | **8-10 hours** |
| **UC-008** | LOW | 2,000-2,500 words | 10-12 ACs | 15-18 test cases | **3-4 hours** |
| **UC-009** | MEDIUM | 2,500-3,000 words | 12-14 ACs | 18-22 test cases | **5-6 hours** |
| **UC-011** | MEDIUM-HIGH | 2,800-3,200 words | 13-15 ACs | 20-24 test cases | **6-8 hours** |
| **UC-007** (P1) | MEDIUM | 2,200-2,800 words | 11-13 ACs | 16-20 test cases | **4-5 hours** |
| **UC-010** (P1) | MEDIUM | 2,300-2,800 words | 11-13 ACs | 17-20 test cases | **4-5 hours** |

**Total P0 Effort** (UC-006, UC-008, UC-009, UC-011): **22-28 hours**

**Total P1 Effort** (UC-007, UC-010): **8-10 hours**

**Total All Pending UCs** (6 use cases): **30-38 hours**

## 5. Elaboration Priority Order for Week 5

### 5.1 Recommended Elaboration Sequence

**Strategy**: Elaborate P0 use cases first (critical path for Construction), then P1 use cases if time permits.

**Priority 1 - Critical Path P0 Use Cases** (22-28 hours):

1. **UC-006 (Traceability Automation)** - FIRST PRIORITY
   - **Rationale**:
     - Highest complexity (graph algorithms, performance optimization) - needs most time
     - Enterprise adoption blocker - compliance critical path
     - Feeds data to UC-007 (metrics) - foundational dependency
   - **Effort**: 8-10 hours
   - **Deliverable**: 3,000-3,500 words, 14-16 ACs, 22-25 test cases, 6-8 NFRs

2. **UC-011 (Security Validation)** - SECOND PRIORITY
   - **Rationale**:
     - Security gate for UC-002 (deployment) - blocks all other UCs if missing
     - Enterprise blocker (security table stakes)
     - Medium-high complexity (attack detection, validators, user approval)
   - **Effort**: 6-8 hours
   - **Deliverable**: 2,800-3,200 words, 13-15 ACs, 20-24 test cases, 5-7 NFRs

3. **UC-009 (Test Templates)** - THIRD PRIORITY
   - **Rationale**:
     - Quality gate for Construction (defines test strategy)
     - Medium complexity (multi-agent orchestration)
     - Depends on UC-004 (orchestration) already partially elaborated
   - **Effort**: 5-6 hours
   - **Deliverable**: 2,500-3,000 words, 12-14 ACs, 18-22 test cases, 5-7 NFRs

4. **UC-008 (Template Selection)** - FOURTH PRIORITY
   - **Rationale**:
     - Onboarding experience (adoption barrier)
     - Lowest complexity (quick win)
     - Low risk of scope creep
   - **Effort**: 3-4 hours
   - **Deliverable**: 2,000-2,500 words, 10-12 ACs, 15-18 test cases, 3-4 NFRs

**Priority 2 - P1 Use Cases** (8-10 hours - defer to Construction Week 1 if time-constrained):

5. **UC-007 (Metrics Collection)** - FIFTH PRIORITY (P1)
   - **Rationale**: Observability feature, depends on UC-006 (traceability data)
   - **Effort**: 4-5 hours
   - **Deliverable**: 2,200-2,800 words, 11-13 ACs, 16-20 test cases, 4-5 NFRs

6. **UC-010 (Plugin Rollback)** - SIXTH PRIORITY (P1)
   - **Rationale**: Risk mitigation feature, manual workaround acceptable for MVP
   - **Effort**: 4-5 hours
   - **Deliverable**: 2,300-2,800 words, 11-13 ACs, 17-20 test cases, 4-5 NFRs

### 5.2 Week 5 Timeline (20-30 Hour Target)

**Elaboration Week 5 Schedule** (assuming 25-30 productive hours):

| Day | Use Case | Effort | Cumulative Hours |
|-----|----------|--------|-----------------|
| **Monday** | UC-006 (Traceability) | 8-10 hours | 8-10 hours |
| **Tuesday** | UC-011 (Security Validation) | 6-8 hours | 14-18 hours |
| **Wednesday** | UC-009 (Test Templates) | 5-6 hours | 19-24 hours |
| **Thursday** | UC-008 (Template Selection) | 3-4 hours | 22-28 hours |
| **Friday** | UC-007 (Metrics - P1) OR Buffer | 4-5 hours (optional) | 26-33 hours |

**Decision Points**:
- **If Week 5 hours limited (20-25 hours)**: Complete Priority 1 only (UC-006, UC-011, UC-009, UC-008)
- **If Week 5 hours available (25-30 hours)**: Add UC-007 (Metrics) on Friday
- **Defer UC-010 (Rollback)** to Construction Week 1 regardless (lowest priority P1)

**Risk Mitigation**:
- **Buffer built in**: UC-006 (8-10 hours) has 2-hour range - if overruns, adjust UC-009/UC-008 scope
- **Scope flexibility**: UC-008 (LOW complexity) can be condensed to 2.5 hours if needed
- **Parallel expansion**: UC-002, UC-003, UC-004 (partially elaborated) expand in Construction as features implemented

## 6. P1 Use Case Deferral Rationale

### 6.1 UC-007 (Metrics Collection) - Deferred to Construction Week 1

**Feature**: FID-002 (Metrics Collection)

**Product Strategist Rationale**:
- "Metrics and rollback are 'nice-to-have' for MVP; focus resources on core value delivery"
- "Metrics nice-to-have, not core value - manual workaround via logs acceptable"

**Manual Workaround for MVP**:
- Users manually inspect `.aiwg/reports/` artifacts for metrics
- Basic metrics captured in retrospectives (velocity, test coverage, story points)
- Iteration summary reports include key metrics (story points completed, test pass rate)

**P1 Enhancement (Version 1.1)**:
- Automated metrics collection (NFR-PERF-006: <5% overhead)
- Historical trend dashboards (NFR-DATA-003: 12-month retention)
- Real-time metric updates (NFR-FRESH-001)

**User Impact**: LOW (manual metrics acceptable for early adopters)

**Elaboration Timing**: Construction Week 1 (parallel to feature implementation) - 4-5 hours

### 6.2 UC-010 (Plugin Rollback) - Deferred to Construction Week 1

**Feature**: FID-005 (Plugin Rollback)

**Product Strategist Rationale**:
- "Rollback rarely needed pre-production - manual workaround acceptable for MVP"
- "Risk mitigation, trust builder, but not primary value"

**Manual Workaround for MVP**:
- Users manually rollback via git: `git reset --hard <commit-before-install>`
- Uninstall script provided: `aiwg -uninstall` (removes `.claude/` directories)
- Backup documentation: Users advised to commit before `aiwg -deploy-agents`

**P1 Enhancement (Version 1.1)**:
- Automated rollback (NFR-PERF-009: <5s rollback)
- Data integrity validation (NFR-REL-003: 100% state restoration)
- Orphan file cleanup (NFR-COMP-005: zero orphan files)

**User Impact**: LOW (rollback rarely needed, git-based workflow acceptable)

**Elaboration Timing**: Construction Week 1 (parallel to feature implementation) - 4-5 hours

### 6.3 P1 vs P0 Trade-Off Analysis

**Decision**: Defer UC-007, UC-010 to Construction Week 1

**Rationale**:
1. **Focus MVP on Core Differentiators**: P0 features (meta-application, traceability, security) build unique value proposition
2. **Resource Alignment**: 22-28 hours (P0 UCs) matches Elaboration Week 5 capacity (25-30 hours)
3. **Manual Workarounds Acceptable**: Early adopters tolerate git-based rollback and manual metrics
4. **Risk Mitigation**: Deferred features have clear P1 roadmap (Version 1.1 in 3 months)
5. **Just-In-Time Elaboration**: UC-007, UC-010 expanded in Construction Week 1 (parallel to implementation)

**Impact**:
- **Timeline**: No delay to Construction start (P0 UCs ready by end of Week 5)
- **Quality**: Focus on P0 UC quality (depth over breadth)
- **Scope**: Clear P1 roadmap (FID-002, FID-005 + 18 P1 NFRs in Version 1.1)

## 7. Construction Phase Readiness

### 7.1 Use Case Baseline for Construction

**Target State by End of Elaboration Week 5**:

| Use Case | Status | Word Count | ACs | Test Cases | Construction Readiness |
|----------|--------|-----------|-----|-----------|----------------------|
| UC-001 | ✅ FULLY ELABORATED | 4,287 words | 8 ACs | 15+ tests | ✅ READY |

**Construction Readiness Summary**:
- **READY**: 6 use cases (UC-001, UC-005, UC-006, UC-008, UC-009, UC-011) - 54% fully ready
- **EXPAND**: 5 use cases (UC-002, UC-003, UC-004, UC-007, UC-010) - 46% expand during Construction

**Critical Path Validated**:
1. ✅ UC-002 (Deploy) - Basic structure sufficient for Construction start (expand in parallel)
2. ✅ UC-011 (Security) - FULLY ELABORATED in Week 5 (gates UC-002)
3. ✅ UC-008 (Template Selection) - FULLY ELABORATED in Week 5 (onboarding)
4. ✅ UC-006 (Traceability) - FULLY ELABORATED in Week 5 (enterprise compliance)
5. ✅ UC-009 (Test Templates) - FULLY ELABORATED in Week 5 (quality gate)
6. ✅ UC-005 (Meta-Application) - FULLY ELABORATED (Week 4) (differentiation)

**Go/No-Go Decision**: ✅ GO for Construction Phase (all P0 UCs ready)

### 7.2 NFR Baseline for Construction

**Total NFRs by End of Week 5**:

**Existing NFRs** (from requirements workshop):
- 48 NFRs (12 P0, 18 P1, 18 P2)

**New NFRs from P0 UC Elaboration** (UC-006, UC-008, UC-009, UC-011):
- +19-26 NFRs (estimated)

**Total NFR Count**: ~67-74 NFRs

**P0 NFR Coverage**:
- ✅ Security (3 NFRs): Content privacy, file permissions, attack detection
- ✅ Usability (3 NFRs): Learning curve, setup time, error clarity
- ✅ Performance (4 NFRs): Validation time, deployment time, analysis time, traceability time
- ✅ Accuracy (3 NFRs): False positives, intake accuracy, traceability accuracy
- ✅ Additional from UC elaboration (6-12 NFRs): Template selection time, test generation time, security validation time, etc.

**Total P0 NFRs**: ~18-24 NFRs (make-or-break for MVP)

**Construction Testing Readiness**:
- ✅ All P0 NFRs measurable (validation protocols defined)
- ✅ Test cases cover NFR validation (75-89 test cases from P0 UCs)
- ⚠️ BLOCKER-002: NFR measurement methodology must be defined in Week 5 (parallel to elaboration)

### 7.3 Test Infrastructure Readiness

**Test Architect Blockers** (from Requirements Status Report):

**BLOCKER-001: Test Infrastructure Specification Missing**
- **Impact**: Cannot execute 30 UC-005 test cases + 75-89 new UC test cases without multi-agent mock framework
- **Owner**: Test Engineer agent
- **Resolution**: Create `.aiwg/testing/test-infrastructure-spec.md` with multi-agent mock design
- **Timeline**: Elaboration Week 5 (parallel to UC elaboration)

**BLOCKER-002: NFR Measurement Methodology Undefined**
- **Impact**: Cannot validate 67-74 NFRs without measurement protocols (e.g., "how to measure <60s?")
- **Owner**: Test Architect
- **Resolution**: Define measurement protocols for all NFR categories (95th percentile, statistical validation, etc.)
- **Timeline**: Elaboration Week 5 (parallel to UC elaboration)

**BLOCKER-003: Test Data Catalog Missing**
- **Impact**: Cannot execute test cases without fixtures (iteration backlog, team profile, spike reports)
- **Owner**: Test Engineer agent
- **Resolution**: Create 19+ test fixtures in `.aiwg/testing/fixtures/`
- **Timeline**: Construction Week 1 (parallel to early feature implementation)

**Recommendation**: Resolve BLOCKER-001 and BLOCKER-002 in Week 5 (parallel to UC elaboration). BLOCKER-003 can be resolved in Construction Week 1.

## 8. Risk Assessment

### 8.1 Elaboration Week 5 Risks

**RISK-001: UC-006 Complexity Overrun**
- **Likelihood**: MEDIUM (HIGH complexity, graph algorithms, performance optimization)
- **Impact**: HIGH (delays entire Week 5 schedule)
- **Mitigation**:
  - Start UC-006 on Monday (full day available)
  - Build 2-hour buffer into estimate (8-10 hours)
  - If overruns, compress UC-008 (LOW complexity) to 2.5 hours
- **Contingency**: Defer UC-007 (P1) to Construction Week 1 regardless

**RISK-002: Test Infrastructure Blockers Not Resolved**
- **Likelihood**: MEDIUM (BLOCKER-001, BLOCKER-002 require parallel work)
- **Impact**: HIGH (delays Construction testing by 1 week)
- **Mitigation**:
  - Assign Test Engineer agent to BLOCKER-001 (parallel to UC elaboration)
  - Assign Test Architect to BLOCKER-002 (parallel to UC elaboration)
  - Track blocker resolution in daily standups
- **Contingency**: Construction can start feature implementation while test infrastructure catches up (1-week buffer)

**RISK-003: Insufficient NFR Coverage in New UCs**
- **Likelihood**: LOW (UC-005 demonstrated 8 NFRs for 16-step workflow)
- **Impact**: MEDIUM (gaps in Supplemental Specification)
- **Mitigation**:
  - Use UC-005 as NFR extraction template (8 NFRs for complex UC)
  - Cross-reference requirements workshop NFR list (48 NFRs) for patterns
  - Add NFR extraction checklist to elaboration workflow
- **Contingency**: Iterate NFRs in Construction Week 1 based on implementation learnings

**RISK-004: AC Business Outcome Metrics Missing**
- **Likelihood**: MEDIUM (Product Strategist identified gap in UC-005 ACs)
- **Impact**: LOW (strategic drift, but not blocker)
- **Mitigation**:
  - Add business outcome metrics to all ACs (e.g., "50% onboarding time reduction")
  - Use Product Strategist review recommendations as template
  - Include productivity, velocity, quality impact metrics
- **Contingency**: Iterate ACs in Construction based on user feedback

### 8.2 Construction Phase Risks

**RISK-005: P1 UC Elaboration Delayed in Construction**
- **Likelihood**: MEDIUM (Construction resource constraints)
- **Impact**: LOW (manual workarounds acceptable for MVP)
- **Mitigation**:
  - UC-007 (Metrics) and UC-010 (Rollback) have clear manual workarounds
  - P1 elaboration can occur in Construction Week 2-3 if Week 1 overruns
  - Manual workaround documentation prepared in advance
- **Contingency**: Defer UC-007, UC-010 to Version 1.1 (3 months post-MVP)

**RISK-006: Partially Elaborated UCs (UC-002, UC-003, UC-004) Insufficient**
- **Likelihood**: LOW (basic structures exist, 1,342-2,456 words)
- **Impact**: MEDIUM (developers lack scenario clarity)
- **Mitigation**:
  - Just-in-time elaboration: Developers flag missing scenarios during implementation
  - Requirements Analyst embedded in Construction iterations (daily availability)
  - Expand UCs in parallel with feature implementation (Weeks 1-2)
- **Contingency**: Pause feature implementation for 1-2 days to complete UC expansion if critical gaps found
