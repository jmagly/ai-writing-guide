# Warp Integration - Complete Specification

## Overview

This directory contains the complete, corrected specification for integrating Warp Terminal with the AI Writing Guide (AIWG) SDLC framework.

**Status**: ✅ Ready for Implementation
**Estimated Effort**: 16-18 hours (2 days)
**Approach**: Mirror proven Claude command pattern with intelligent merge

---

## Documents

### 1. WARP-INTEGRATION-REVISED.md

**Purpose**: Main integration document with official Warp documentation cross-reference

**Key Content**:
- Warp's native file support (CLAUDE.md ✅, .claude/agents/*.md ❌)
- Revised integration approach (WARP.md + aggregated CLAUDE.md)
- File structure recommendations
- Implementation plan phases
- Comparison with archived original plan

**Key Discovery**:
> Warp supports `CLAUDE.md` as a rules file but does NOT document support for `.claude/agents/` subdirectories. All agent/command content must be aggregated into single CLAUDE.md file for Warp compatibility.

---

### 2. WARP-SMART-MERGE-STRATEGY.md

**Purpose**: Intelligent merge strategy addressing Warp's `/init` behavior

**Key Content**:
- Warp copies CLAUDE.md → WARP.md during `/init`
- Smart section detection (user vs AIWG-managed)
- Merge algorithm preserving user content
- Idempotent update support
- CLI usage examples

**Key Insight**:
> Warp's `/init` command copies existing rules files into WARP.md. Need intelligent line-based merging (like existing CLAUDE.md approach) to preserve user content while updating AIWG sections.

---

### 3. WARP-COMMANDS-SPEC.md

**Purpose**: Detailed specification for two new commands mirroring Claude pattern

**Commands**:

#### `/project:aiwg-setup-warp`
- Mirrors: `/project:aiwg-setup-project`
- Use: Initial Warp setup or merge with existing WARP.md
- Creates: Aggregated WARP.md with 58 agents + 42 commands
- Preserves: All user-specific rules and conventions

#### `/project:aiwg-update-warp`
- Mirrors: `/project:aiwg-update-claude`
- Use: Update existing WARP.md with latest AIWG content
- Behavior: Intelligent section replacement with backup
- Requires: Existing WARP.md (fails gracefully if missing)

**Implementation**: `tools/warp/setup-warp.mjs` (single script, dual modes)

---

## Why This Approach?

### 1. Leverage Proven Pattern

**Existing Claude commands work**:
- `/project:aiwg-setup-project` - 432 lines, battle-tested
- `/project:aiwg-update-claude` - 525 lines, intelligent merge

**Benefits**:
- 80%+ code reuse (path resolution, section parsing, validation)
- Known-good merge logic
- Comprehensive error handling
- Clear user feedback

### 2. Respect Warp's Architecture

**Warp uses**:
- Single `WARP.md` file (not subdirectories)
- Native support for `CLAUDE.md` as rules file
- Automatic loading on `/init`

**Our approach**:
- Generate `WARP.md` with aggregated content
- Use `CLAUDE.md` for cross-platform compatibility (optional)
- Intelligent merge preserves user content
- Idempotent updates (safe to run multiple times)

### 3. Minimize Transformation

**Original plan** (archived):
- 178 hours of custom transformation logic
- Semantic mapping from agent format to Warp rules
- Complex model assignment logic
- Brittle to format changes

**Revised plan**:
- 16-18 hours leveraging existing patterns
- Simple aggregation (parse frontmatter, format sections)
- No semantic transformation needed
- Resilient to Warp format evolution

## Implementation Checklist

### Phase 1: Script Development (6-8 hours)

- [ ] Create `tools/warp/setup-warp.mjs`
- [ ] Implement AIWG path resolution (reuse from Claude commands)
- [ ] Implement section parsing (reuse from Claude commands)
- [ ] Implement agent aggregation (parse .md files, format sections)
- [ ] Implement command aggregation (parse .md files, format sections)
- [ ] Implement intelligent merge (detect user vs AIWG sections)
- [ ] Add dual-mode support (setup vs update)
- [ ] Add backup creation (update mode)
- [ ] Add validation checks

**Code reuse**: 80% from existing Claude commands

### Phase 2: Template Creation (2 hours)

- [ ] Create `templates/warp/WARP.md.aiwg-base`
- [ ] Include AIWG orchestration overview
- [ ] Add placeholders for aggregated agents/commands
- [ ] Add merge markers (`<!-- AIWG SDLC Framework (auto-updated) -->`)
- [ ] Test template rendering

### Phase 3: CLI Integration (1 hour)

- [ ] Update `install.sh`
- [ ] Add `aiwg -setup-warp` command
- [ ] Add `aiwg -update-warp` command (alias to --update flag)
- [ ] Update help text
- [ ] Test CLI routing

### Phase 4: Testing (5 hours)

- [ ] Test new project (no WARP.md)
- [ ] Test existing WARP.md (no AIWG content)
- [ ] Test existing WARP.md (with AIWG content)
- [ ] Test update mode (no WARP.md - should fail)
- [ ] Test dry-run mode
- [ ] Test force mode
- [ ] Test with Warp Terminal `/init`
- [ ] Validate agent/command counts
- [ ] Validate user content preservation

### Phase 5: Documentation (2 hours)

- [ ] Create `docs/integrations/warp-terminal.md`
- [ ] Document `aiwg -setup-warp` usage
- [ ] Document `aiwg -update-warp` usage
- [ ] Add troubleshooting section
- [ ] Update main README.md
- [ ] Update CLAUDE.md with Warp compatibility note
