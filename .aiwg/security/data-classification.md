## Purpose and Scope

### Purpose
This document defines the data classification framework for the AI Writing Guide open source project to establish clear understanding of data sensitivity levels and appropriate handling requirements.

### Scope
- **In Scope**: All data created, processed, stored, or transmitted by the framework
- **Applicability**: Framework maintainers, contributors, users deploying the framework
- **Coverage**: Documentation files, user-generated artifacts, repository metadata
- **Lifecycle**: Data classification applies from creation through disposal

### Objectives
1. Clarify data sensitivity levels for an open source documentation framework
2. Establish appropriate handling requirements for each data type
3. Guide users on securing their own project artifacts
4. Document the framework's minimal data footprint
5. Enable informed decisions about artifact storage and sharing

## Classification Levels

### Level 1: PUBLIC

#### Definition
Information intentionally shared with the public through the open source repository without restriction.

#### Examples
- All framework documentation (485+ markdown files)
- Writing guides and validation patterns
- SDLC templates and workflows
- Agent definitions (61 agents)
- Command definitions (45 commands)
- Installation scripts and tooling
- GitHub repository content
- README files and usage guides
- Example content and patterns
- MIT license text

#### Handling Requirements

| Requirement | Specification |
|-------------|---------------|
| **Access Control** | None - publicly accessible via GitHub |
| **Encryption at Rest** | Not required (GitHub handles repository storage) |
| **Encryption in Transit** | HTTPS for GitHub access |
| **Storage Location** | GitHub public repository |
| **Sharing** | Unrestricted - MIT license allows copying/modification |
| **Retention** | Indefinite - version controlled in Git |
| **Disposal** | N/A - permanent public record |
| **Backup** | Git distributed version control |
| **Logging** | GitHub access logs (platform-managed) |
| **Monitoring** | GitHub Insights (stars, forks, traffic) |

#### Protection Measures
- Git version control for integrity
- GitHub platform security
- MIT license attribution requirement
- No additional controls needed

---

### Level 2: USER-OWNED

#### Definition
Artifacts generated by users when applying the framework to their own projects. Sensitivity varies based on user's project context.

#### Examples
- `.aiwg/intake/` - Project intake forms
- `.aiwg/requirements/` - User stories, use cases, vision documents
- `.aiwg/architecture/` - Software architecture documents, ADRs
- `.aiwg/testing/` - Test plans and strategies
- `.aiwg/security/` - Threat models, security assessments
- `.aiwg/deployment/` - Deployment plans and runbooks
- `.aiwg/risks/` - Risk registers and mitigation plans
- `.aiwg/team/` - Team profiles and assignments
- Custom project-specific content

#### Handling Requirements

| Requirement | Specification |
|-------------|---------------|
| **Access Control** | User's responsibility - framework provides `.gitignore` guidance |
| **Encryption at Rest** | User's decision based on project sensitivity |
| **Encryption in Transit** | User's responsibility (Git HTTPS/SSH) |
| **Storage Location** | User's project directory (local or repository) |
| **Sharing** | User determines (public, private, or internal) |
| **Retention** | User's retention policy applies |
| **Disposal** | User manages lifecycle |
| **Backup** | User's backup strategy |
| **Logging** | User's audit requirements |
| **Monitoring** | User's security monitoring |

#### Protection Measures
- **Framework Guidance**:
  - Default `.aiwg/` directory structure for organization
  - Recommended `.gitignore` patterns in documentation
  - Clear separation from framework files
- **User Responsibility**:
  - Determine sensitivity of their project
  - Apply appropriate Git privacy settings
  - Implement security controls as needed
  - Comply with their regulatory requirements

---

### Level 3: LOCAL-ONLY

#### Definition
Framework installation metadata that remains on user's local machine and is never transmitted or collected.

#### Examples
- Installation path (`~/.local/share/ai-writing-guide/`)
- Local Git repository clone
- Bash history of `aiwg` commands
- Local file system permissions
- User's shell configuration updates
- Temporary working files during operations

#### Handling Requirements

| Requirement | Specification |
|-------------|---------------|
| **Access Control** | Operating system file permissions |
| **Encryption at Rest** | User's disk encryption (if enabled) |
| **Encryption in Transit** | N/A - never transmitted |
| **Storage Location** | User's local file system only |
| **Sharing** | None - local only |
| **Retention** | Until user uninstalls |
| **Disposal** | Standard file deletion on uninstall |
| **Backup** | User's system backup (if configured) |
| **Logging** | None by framework |
| **Monitoring** | None by framework |

#### Protection Measures
- No telemetry or analytics collection
- No phone-home functionality
- No usage tracking
- Standard Unix file permissions
- User controls all local data

---

### Level 4: NON-EXISTENT (No Restricted Data)

#### Definition
The AI Writing Guide framework does NOT collect, process, or store any restricted/sensitive data.

#### Data Types NOT Present
- **No Personal Identifiable Information (PII)**:
  - No user accounts or authentication
  - No email addresses collected
  - No names, addresses, or contact information
  - No social security numbers or government IDs

- **No Payment Information**:
  - No credit card processing
  - No payment data (framework is free)
  - No financial transactions

- **No Health Information**:
  - No PHI or medical records
  - No HIPAA-covered data

- **No Authentication Credentials**:
  - No passwords or API keys stored
  - No user authentication system
  - No session management

- **No Regulated Data**:
  - No GDPR personal data collection
  - No PCI DSS payment data
  - No HIPAA protected health information
  - No FERPA education records

## Classification Decision Matrix

| Data Type | Classification | Owner | Rationale |
|-----------|---------------|-------|-----------|
| Framework documentation | PUBLIC | Framework maintainer | Intentionally open source |
| SDLC templates | PUBLIC | Framework maintainer | Designed for public use |
| Agent definitions | PUBLIC | Framework maintainer | Shared community resource |
| Writing validation patterns | PUBLIC | Framework maintainer | Core public offering |
| User's intake forms | USER-OWNED | User | Contains user's project details |
| User's requirements docs | USER-OWNED | User | Project-specific artifacts |
| User's architecture docs | USER-OWNED | User | May contain proprietary designs |
| User's test plans | USER-OWNED | User | May reveal system details |
| Installation directory | LOCAL-ONLY | User | Local file system only |
| GitHub stars/forks | PUBLIC | GitHub platform | Public metrics |
| Contributor names | PUBLIC | Contributors | Public Git history |

## Special Considerations

### Open Source License (MIT)

The framework is distributed under the MIT License, which means:
- All framework content is PUBLIC by design
- Users can freely copy, modify, and distribute
- Attribution is required when using the framework
- No warranty or liability for the framework authors

### User Artifact Management

Users deploying the framework should consider:

1. **Project Sensitivity Assessment**:
   - Is your project public or private?
   - Does it contain proprietary information?
   - Are there regulatory requirements?

2. **Git Repository Strategy**:
   - **Option 1**: Commit `.aiwg/` artifacts for audit trail
   - **Option 2**: Add `.aiwg/` to `.gitignore` for local-only use
   - **Option 3**: Selective commit (intake public, sensitive private)

3. **Team Collaboration**:
   - Shared artifacts need consistent classification
   - Team agreement on commit vs. ignore strategy
   - Access control via repository permissions

### No Data Collection

**The AI Writing Guide framework**:
- ✅ Does NOT collect any user data
- ✅ Does NOT track usage or telemetry
- ✅ Does NOT require registration or accounts
- ✅ Does NOT phone home or check for updates automatically
- ✅ Does NOT store any credentials or secrets
- ✅ Does NOT process any PII or regulated data

**Users are responsible for**:
- Classification of their own project artifacts
- Security controls for their generated content
- Compliance with their applicable regulations
- Protection of any sensitive data in their projects

## Compliance Considerations

### GDPR (Not Applicable)
- Framework collects no personal data
- No GDPR requirements apply to framework itself
- Users must handle their own GDPR compliance

### PCI DSS (Not Applicable)
- Framework processes no payment data
- No PCI DSS requirements apply
- Users in payment industry must secure their artifacts

### HIPAA (Not Applicable)
- Framework handles no health information
- No HIPAA requirements apply
- Healthcare users must protect PHI in their artifacts

### SOC 2 (Not Applicable)
- Framework is not a service organization
- No SOC 2 controls required
- Enterprise users handle their own compliance

## Security Requirements by Classification

### PUBLIC Data (Framework Content)
- **Requirements**: None beyond GitHub platform security
- **Controls**: Version control, MIT license
- **Risks**: None (intentionally public)

### USER-OWNED Data (Generated Artifacts)
- **Requirements**: User-determined based on project
- **Recommended Controls**:
  - Use `.gitignore` for sensitive artifacts
  - Encrypt repositories containing confidential data
  - Apply organizational security policies
  - Regular review of committed content
- **Risks**: Accidental exposure if misconfigured

### LOCAL-ONLY Data (Installation)
- **Requirements**: Standard OS file permissions
- **Controls**: User's system security
- **Risks**: Minimal (no sensitive data)

## Training and Awareness

### For Framework Users

**Key Points to Understand**:
1. Framework itself is completely PUBLIC (open source)
2. Your generated artifacts are YOUR responsibility
3. No data is collected or transmitted by the framework
4. Classification depends on YOUR project's sensitivity

**Recommended Practices**:
1. Assess your project's data sensitivity
2. Configure `.gitignore` appropriately
3. Review artifacts before committing
4. Apply your organization's data policies
5. Separate public examples from private work

### For Framework Contributors

**Guidelines**:
1. Never add user-specific data to framework
2. Keep examples generic and sanitized
3. Maintain clear PUBLIC classification
4. Document any new data handling clearly
5. Preserve user privacy and autonomy

## Review and Updates

### Review Schedule
- Annual review of this classification guide
- Update when framework scope changes significantly
- Revise if data collection is ever added (currently none)
