# AI Writing Guide - Project Intake Documentation

**Generated**: 2025-10-15
**Command**: `/intake-from-codebase /home/manitcor/dev/ai-writing-guide`
**Purpose**: Self-documentation demonstration of the intake-from-codebase command

## Contents

This directory contains comprehensive intake documentation for the AI Writing Guide project, generated by analyzing the codebase automatically.

### Files

1. **[project-intake.md](project-intake.md)** - Comprehensive project documentation
   - Metadata and overview
   - Problem statement and target personas
   - Current scope and features (writing guide + SDLC framework)
   - Architecture and components (54 agents, 32 commands, tooling)
   - Scale, security, team, and operations analysis
   - Dependencies and infrastructure
   - Known issues and technical debt

2. **[solution-profile.md](solution-profile.md)** - Current state assessment and improvement roadmap
   - Current profile: Prototype transitioning to Production
   - Security, reliability, testing, and process maturity analysis
   - Recommended profile adjustments (â†’ Production for v1.0)
   - Detailed improvement roadmap (immediate, short-term, long-term)
   - Risk assessment and mitigation strategies
   - Success criteria for profile transition

3. **[option-matrix.md](option-matrix.md)** - Improvement path analysis with weighted scoring
   - **Option A**: Minimal Stability (versioning only) - Score: 4.1/5
   - **Option B**: Lightweight Production Readiness (recommended) - Score: 4.0/5
   - **Option C**: Multi-Contributor Governance (future) - Score: 2.9/5
   - Detailed 4-week implementation plan for Option B
   - Post-v1.0 roadmap and sensitivity analysis
   - Success metrics and risk mitigation

4. **[ANALYSIS_REPORT.md](ANALYSIS_REPORT.md)** - Technical analysis summary
   - Executive summary and key findings
   - Evidence-based inferences with confidence levels
   - Detailed architecture, infrastructure, security, and team assessments
   - Quality assessment (strengths and weaknesses)
   - Prioritized recommendations
   - Next steps and conclusion

## Key Findings

### Current State

**Status**: Active prototype (75 commits in last 3 months, 70 in last week)

**Strengths**:
- Comprehensive documentation (excellent)
- Clear architecture (modular, extensible)
- Automated quality gates (10+ markdown linters, CI/CD)
- Active development (high velocity)

**Gaps**:
- No semantic versioning or releases
- No automated testing for Node.js scripts
- Solo developer (bus factor = 1)

### Recommended Path

**Option B - Lightweight Production Readiness** (4 weeks to v1.0.0):

1. **Week 1**: Add versioning and GitHub releases
2. **Week 2**: Add basic smoke tests
3. **Week 3**: Cross-platform validation
4. **Week 4**: Launch v1.0.0

**Expected Outcomes**:
- Professional v1.0 release with testing
- User trust through versioned releases
- Foundation for sustainable growth
- Minimal process overhead (lightweight)

## Usage

### Review the Intake Documents

1. Start with **ANALYSIS_REPORT.md** for high-level overview
2. Review **project-intake.md** for comprehensive project details
3. Check **solution-profile.md** for current state and improvement roadmap
4. Evaluate **option-matrix.md** for improvement paths and scoring

### Next Actions

If you accept the recommendations:

1. **Immediate** (this week):
   - Create CHANGELOG.md with project history
   - Tag v1.0.0-rc.1 release candidate
   - Create GitHub release with documentation

2. **Short-term** (this month):
   - Add smoke tests for deploy-agents.mjs, new-project.mjs, install.sh
   - Test installation on Ubuntu, macOS, WSL
   - Document upgrade procedure

3. **Medium-term** (this quarter):
   - Launch v1.0.0 production release
   - Expand CONTRIBUTING.md for community
   - Continue feature development per ROADMAP.md

## Methodology

This intake was generated by analyzing:

- **File structure**: 3,403 files (759 markdown, 38 JavaScript, 61 JSON)
- **Git history**: 75 commits, 1 contributor (Joseph Magly)
- **Documentation**: README, CLAUDE.md, USAGE_GUIDE, PROJECT_SUMMARY, ROADMAP
- **Tooling**: Installation scripts, deployment automation, linters
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions workflows for quality gates
- **Architecture**: Agent framework, command system, template library

**Confidence**: 85% high confidence (direct code evidence), 10% medium (patterns), 5% low (usage metrics unknown)

## Demonstration Value

This intake demonstrates the `/intake-from-codebase` command on a real project (the AI Writing Guide itself), showing:

1. **Automated analysis**: No manual input required (comprehensive codebase scanning)
2. **Evidence-based**: Inferences from direct code observation
3. **Practical recommendations**: Actionable improvement paths with timelines
4. **Balanced scoring**: Weighted option matrix for decision-making
5. **Professional output**: Production-ready intake documentation

The generated documents are immediately usable for:
- Project planning (roadmap alignment)
- Process improvement (quality gates, testing, releases)
- Stakeholder communication (clear status and path forward)
- SDLC adoption (baseline for phase progression)

## Questions or Feedback

If you have questions about the generated intake or recommendations:

1. Review the **ANALYSIS_REPORT.md** for evidence and confidence levels
2. Check the **option-matrix.md** for alternative improvement paths
3. Consult the **solution-profile.md** for detailed capability assessment
4. Refer to the **project-intake.md** for comprehensive project documentation

This intake is a living document - update as the project evolves and re-run `/intake-from-codebase` periodically to track changes.
