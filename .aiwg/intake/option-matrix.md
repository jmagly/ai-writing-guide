## Step 1: Stakeholder Context

**Primary Stakeholders**:
- [x] Internal team (personal project, R&D, innovation lab) - Solo developer (Joseph Magly)
- [ ] Business unit (departmental tool, internal product)
- [x] External customers (B2B SaaS, consumer app, public service) - Open source community
- [ ] Regulatory bodies (compliance-driven, audit requirements)
- [x] Other: **Open source contributors, Enterprise SDLC adopters**

**Project Type**:
- [ ] Proof of concept / Prototype
- [x] **Minimum viable product (MVP)** - Publicly distributed, active users, but still evolving
- [ ] Production service (established users)
- [ ] Mission-critical system (enterprise-grade)

**Known Constraints**:
- **Budget**: Unconstrained (volunteer open source work, zero operating costs)
- **Timeline**: Flexible (no hard deadlines, roadmap-driven development)
- **Team size**: 1 developer (solo maintainer, future community contributors)
- **Regulatory**: None (public documentation, no PII, no compliance requirements)
- **Contractual**: None (MIT license, no SLAs, best-effort support)
- **Technical debt**: Greenfield (started recently, 84 commits in 3 months, no legacy constraints)

**Special Considerations**:
- **Credibility-critical**: Framework positioning requires self-application (dogfooding)
- **Community scalability**: Must enable contributions (stable releases, clear process)
- **Sustainability**: Solo developer bus factor (need documentation, process, community)

---

## Step 2: Priority Weighting (must sum to 1.0)

| Criterion | Weight | Rationale |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| **Delivery speed** | `0.25` | Maintain rapid iteration (28 commits/month sustainable), but not at expense of quality |
| **Cost efficiency** | `0.20` | Time-constrained (unpaid open source), but willing to invest in framework credibility |
| **Quality/security** | `0.30` | **Highest priority** - Framework credibility depends on self-application and quality |
| **Reliability/scale** | `0.25` | Community adoption requires stable releases, but not mission-critical uptime |
| **TOTAL** | **1.00** | Balanced approach favoring credibility and community scalability |

**Weighting Rationale**:
- **Quality is paramount** (0.30) - Framework must prove itself through self-use
- **Velocity matters** (0.25) - Solo developer needs efficiency, rapid feedback
- **Scalability critical** (0.25) - Community contributions reduce bus factor
- **Cost is time** (0.20) - Efficient processes preferred, but quality investment accepted

---

## Step 3: Profile Scoring (0-5 scale)

| Profile | Speed | Cost | Quality | Reliability | **Weighted Total** |
|---------|------:|-----:|--------:|------------:|-------------------:|
| **Prototype** | 5 | 5 | 1 | 1 | (5×0.25)+(5×0.20)+(1×0.30)+(1×0.25) = **2.80** |
| **MVP** | 4 | 4 | 3 | 3 | (4×0.25)+(4×0.20)+(3×0.30)+(3×0.25) = **3.55** ⭐ |
| **Production** | 3 | 2 | 4 | 4 | (3×0.25)+(2×0.20)+(4×0.30)+(4×0.25) = **3.40** |
| **Enterprise** | 1 | 1 | 5 | 5 | (1×0.25)+(1×0.20)+(5×0.30)+(5×0.25) = **3.20** |

**Analysis**:
- **Prototype** (2.80): Too lightweight - undermines framework credibility (can't advocate SDLC without using it!)
- **MVP** (3.55): **Best fit** - Balances velocity with baseline quality gates, enables community contributions
- **Production** (3.40): Close second - Comprehensive but may slow solo developer too much
- **Enterprise** (3.20): Over-engineered for documentation framework (no runtime system, no compliance needs)

---

## Step 5: Decision & Rationale

**Recommended Profile**: **MVP** (with selective Production-level elements)

**Rationale**:

1. **Scoring**: MVP has highest weighted score (3.55)
2. **Framework credibility**: MVP provides baseline self-application (validates framework effectiveness)
3. **Solo developer sustainability**: MVP balances quality with velocity (10-15% overhead acceptable)
4. **Community enablement**: MVP enables stable releases, clear contribution process
5. **Cost efficiency**: MVP fits time constraints (incremental adoption, automated where possible)

**No Overrides**:
- No regulatory compliance required (documentation framework, public content)
- No contractual SLAs (open source, best-effort)
- No budget constraints forcing profile downgrade
- Solo developer can execute MVP with reasonable effort

**Tailoring Notes** (MVP baseline + selective upgrades):

**Apply MORE rigor** (Production-level elements):
- ✓ **Versioning**: Semantic versioning with git tags (enables stable integrations)
- ✓ **Testing**: 30%+ coverage for tooling (ensures reliability for community)
- ✓ **Documentation**: Comprehensive (framework credibility requires excellent docs)
- ✓ **CI/CD**: Automated quality gates (markdown linting, manifest validation)

**Apply LESS rigor** (skip Enterprise elements):
- ✗ Formal code review (solo developer - not feasible)
- ✗ Comprehensive compliance audits (no regulatory requirements)
- ✗ 24/7 on-call rotation (best-effort support model)
- ✗ Chaos engineering / DR drills (documentation framework, not runtime system)

**Phased Approach**:
- **Weeks 1-2**: Adopt core MVP (versioning, P0 completion, basic testing)
- **Month 1**: Add Production testing (30% coverage, automated validation)
- **Months 2-3**: Community scaling (CONTRIBUTING.md, issue templates, branch protection)
- **Reassess at v2.0.0** (6 months): Consider Production profile if community grows

## Step 6: Profile Evolution Plan

**Current Profile**: **MVP** (transitioning from Prototype)

**Planned Evolution**:
- [x] Prototype → **MVP** (in progress: intake generation, versioning planned)
- [ ] MVP → Production (trigger: 5+ active contributors OR 1000+ active users)
- [ ] Production → Enterprise (unlikely - not applicable for documentation framework)

**Evolution Triggers**:

| Trigger Event | Profile Upgrade | Timeline |
|--------------|----------------|----------|
| First community contribution merged | Stay MVP (validate process) | Month 2-3 |
| 5+ active contributors | **MVP → Production** | Month 6-12 |
| 1000+ active users (ROADMAP.md target) | **MVP → Production** | Month 6-12 |
| First enterprise adoption (white-label request) | Consider Production | As needed |
| Security incident or major bug | Immediate Production upgrade | If occurs |

**No Enterprise Evolution Planned**:
- Documentation framework doesn't need Enterprise profile
- No compliance requirements (GDPR, HIPAA, SOX, etc.)
- No mission-critical runtime system to protect
- Community-driven support model (not 24/7 SLA)

---

## Step 7: Implications & Trade-offs

**Selected Profile**: **MVP** (with Production testing/versioning)

**What You're Optimizing For**:
- ✓ **Framework credibility** (self-applying SDLC validates approach)
- ✓ **Development velocity** (maintains 24+ commits/month productivity)
- ✓ **Community scalability** (stable releases enable contributions)
- ✓ **Sustainability** (documentation and process reduce bus factor)
- ✓ **Quality assurance** (testing and automation ensure reliability)

**What You're Sacrificing**:
- ✗ **Maximum speed** (10-15% velocity reduction from process overhead)
- ✗ **Zero overhead** (must maintain tests, documentation, versioning)
- ✗ **Complete flexibility** (committed to SDLC process discipline)

**Risks to Monitor**:

| Risk | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|------------|------------|
| **Process overhead slows velocity below 15 commits/month** | Medium | Scale back to Prototype temporarily, automate more, seek contributors |
| **Solo developer burnout** | Medium | Community contributions, modular design (can pause features), clear boundaries |
| **Community contributions slow without Production profile** | Low | MVP sufficient initially, upgrade if needed based on feedback |
| **Framework credibility gap if not self-applying** | **High** | **Priority mitigation**: Complete intake, adopt dual-track iterations, document learnings |

**Acceptance Criteria** (when to revisit this decision):

**Upgrade to Production if**:
- 5+ active contributors (process scales beyond solo developer)
- 1000+ active users reached (reliability becomes critical)
- Enterprise adoption requests (white-label, custom support)
- Community feedback indicates MVP insufficient

**Downgrade to Prototype if**:
- Velocity drops below 15 commits/month for 2+ months (unsustainable overhead)
- Solo developer time constraints worsen (need maximum efficiency)
- Framework positioning changes (becomes personal tool vs. community framework)

**Reassess**:
- **Next review**: 30 days after v1.0.0 release (validate MVP overhead is sustainable)
- **Milestone review**: v2.0.0 planning (6 months, reassess based on community growth)

## Summary

**MVP Profile** is the right fit for AI Writing Guide because:

1. **Validates framework effectiveness** (self-application proves it works for solo dev → teams)
2. **Balances velocity and quality** (maintains productivity while adding essential gates)
3. **Enables community growth** (stable releases, clear process, contribution-friendly)
4. **Matches project reality** (open source, documentation framework, solo developer)
5. **Supports roadmap goals** (credibility → adoption → community → sustainability)

**Immediate Actions** (MVP adoption):
- [x] Generate intake documents (completed)
- [ ] Adopt semantic versioning (tag v0.9.0, plan v1.0.0)
- [ ] Complete P0 TODO items (documentation sync)
- [ ] Add basic testing (30% coverage target)
- [ ] Create CHANGELOG.md (retroactive + ongoing)
- [ ] Start dual-track iteration planning (use own framework!)

**Key Success Metric**: "We ship faster and with higher quality *because* we use our own SDLC framework, not despite it."
