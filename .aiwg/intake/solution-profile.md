# Solution Profile (Current System)

**Document Type**: Existing System Profile
**Generated**: 2025-10-15

## Current Profile

**Profile**: **Development** → **Production** (Transitioning)

**Selection Rationale**:
- **System Status**: Open source project in active development
- **User Base**: Community-driven (not yet at production scale)
- **Maturity**: Solo developer with comprehensive documentation
- **Process Rigor**: CI/CD automation, systematic documentation
- **Deployment**: Public distribution via GitHub and installer

**Actual Profile**: Development with Production-Ready Components

This is a **documentation and tooling framework** rather than a runtime system. It exhibits characteristics of both Development (active iteration, solo developer) and Production (public distribution, automated quality gates, comprehensive documentation).

## Current State Characteristics

### Security

- **Posture**: **Baseline**
- **Controls Present**:
  - Public repository with open source license (MIT)
  - .gitignore excludes secrets and credentials
  - No hardcoded sensitive data
  - Documentation includes security reminders
  - SDLC framework provides security agents and gates
- **Gaps**:
  - No branch protection rules (acceptable for solo developer)
  - No automated security scanning (low risk for documentation)
  - No dependency scanning (zero npm dependencies)
  - No code signing for distribution
- **Recommendation**: **Maintain Baseline** (appropriate for open source documentation project)
  - Add branch protection if community contributions increase
  - Consider Sigstore signing for future releases
  - No urgent security improvements needed

### Reliability

- **Current SLOs**: Not applicable (static content distribution)
  - **Availability**: GitHub uptime (99.9%+)
  - **Latency**: Git clone/pull speed (seconds)
  - **Error Rate**: CI pipeline success rate (~95% estimated from commit frequency)
- **Monitoring Maturity**:
  - **Metrics**: GitHub Actions success/failure
  - **Logs**: Git commit history
  - **Traces**: Not applicable
  - **Alerting**: GitHub Actions email notifications
- **Recommendation**: **Add Basic Monitoring**
  - Track installer success rate (telemetry opt-in)
  - Monitor agent deployment failures
  - Add health check for key template integrity

### Testing & Quality

- **Test Coverage**: Manual validation only (no automated test suite)
- **Test Types**:
  - **Linting**: Comprehensive (10 markdown checks via GitHub Actions)
  - **Manifest validation**: Automated (sync checks in CI)
  - **Integration**: Manual (agent deployment tested locally)
  - **No unit/e2e tests**: Tooling scripts unvalidated
- **Quality Gates**:
  - ✓ CI markdown linting (lint-fixcheck.yml)
  - ✓ Manifest consistency checks
  - ✗ Automated tool script testing
  - ✗ Agent deployment validation
- **Recommendation**: **Add Automated Testing**
  - Target: Basic test coverage for .mjs tooling (30-50%)
  - Add smoke tests for agent deployment
  - Validate manifest generation idempotency
  - Test CLI wrapper functionality

### Process Rigor

- **SDLC Adoption**: **Partial** (Framework creator, not yet self-applying)
  - ✓ Documentation-driven development
  - ✓ CI/CD automation
  - ✓ Comprehensive intake templates available
  - ✗ Not using own SDLC framework (irony alert!)
  - ✗ No formal iteration planning
  - ✗ No traceability artifacts
- **Code Review**: Not applicable (solo developer)
- **Documentation**: **Excellent**
  - ✓ README, CLAUDE.md, USAGE_GUIDE
  - ✓ ROADMAP with 12-month plan
  - ✓ PROJECT_SUMMARY with value proposition
  - ✓ Comprehensive template library
  - ⚠ Some drift (TODO items in P0-IMPLEMENTATION-SUMMARY.md)
- **Recommendation**: **Self-Apply SDLC Framework**
  - Use own intake process to formalize current state
  - Adopt dual-track iteration planning
  - Create architecture decision records (ADRs)
  - Establish traceability from roadmap to implementation

## Recommended Profile Adjustments

**Current Profile**: Development (active iteration, solo developer)

**Recommended Profile**: **Production-Ready Development** (hybrid approach)

**Rationale**:
- Project is **publicly distributed** (installer, CLI, GitHub)
- Users depend on **stability** (framework for SDLC adoption)
- Development velocity remains **high** (28 commits/month)
- Solo developer needs **agility** (lightweight process)

**Tailoring Notes**:

### Keep Lightweight (Solo Developer Efficiency)
- No heavyweight processes (lengthy reviews, excessive documentation)
- Maintain rapid iteration cycle
- Use automation over manual processes
- Leverage GitHub Actions for quality gates

### Add Stability (User Trust)
- **Versioning**: Adopt semantic versioning (git tags)
  - `v1.0.0` for initial stable release
  - `v1.1.0` for new agents/commands
  - `v1.0.1` for bug fixes
- **Releases**: GitHub Releases with changelogs
- **Breaking changes**: Documented in CHANGELOG.md
- **Deprecation policy**: 1 version notice before removal

### Improve Quality (Framework Credibility)
- **Testing**: Add smoke tests for critical tooling
- **Validation**: Automated agent deployment checks
- **Documentation sync**: Manifest regeneration on template changes
- **Self-dogfooding**: Use own SDLC framework for development

### Scale Community (Future-Proofing)
- **Contribution guidelines**: Expand CONTRIBUTING.md
- **Issue templates**: Add for bugs, features, agent submissions
- **Pull request template**: Guide community contributions
- **Branch protection**: Require CI passing before merge (when contributors join)

## Improvement Roadmap

### Phase 1: Immediate (1-2 weeks)

**Priority**: Stability and Self-Application

1. **Adopt Semantic Versioning**
   - Tag current state as `v0.9.0` (pre-release)
   - Plan `v1.0.0` release with complete P0 items
   - Add version to README and CLI output

2. **Complete Pending TODOs**
   - Update framework-inventory.md
   - Regenerate manifests for new templates
