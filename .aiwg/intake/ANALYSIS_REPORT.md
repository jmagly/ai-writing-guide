## Evidence-Based Inferences

### High Confidence (Direct Code Evidence)

**Architecture and Components**:
- Multi-layered documentation framework with clear separation:
  - Writing guide content (core/, validation/, examples/, patterns/)
  - General-purpose agents (3 writing-focused agents)
  - SDLC framework (51 specialized role agents, 24 commands)
  - Distribution tooling (deploy-agents, new-project, installer)
  - Quality automation (10+ markdown linters, manifest sync)

**Technology Stack**:
- Node.js >= 18.20.8 (enforced by installer)
- Markdown (primary content format)
- Shell scripting (Bash for installation)
- GitHub Actions (CI/CD for quality gates)
- Git-based distribution (no npm package)

**Quality Practices**:
- Comprehensive documentation (README, CLAUDE.md, USAGE_GUIDE, PROJECT_SUMMARY, ROADMAP)
- Custom markdown linters (MD012, MD022, MD026, MD031, MD032, MD038, MD040, MD041, MD047, MD058)
- CI enforcement (lint-fixcheck.yml workflow)
- Manifest drift detection (sync-manifests.mjs)
- Automated formatting standardization

**Distribution Model**:
- One-line installer: `curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/.../install.sh | bash`
- Install location: `~/.local/share/ai-writing-guide`
- CLI integration: `aiwg` command with auto-update
- Agent deployment: `aiwg -deploy-agents` to target projects
- Project scaffolding: `aiwg -new` for SDLC templates

### Medium Confidence (Patterns and Conventions)

**Development Philosophy**:
- Documentation-first approach (comprehensive guides before code)
- Authenticity focus (avoiding AI detection patterns)
- Token optimization (agent context isolation)
- Practical over theoretical (real examples, not abstractions)

**Target Audience**:
- Individual developers using AI coding assistants
- Development teams adopting SDLC processes
- Technical writers creating authentic content
- Enterprise organizations needing compliance-ready frameworks

**Business Model**:
- Open source (MIT license)
- Community-driven (GitHub repository)
- No monetization detected (pure open source)

**Process Maturity**:
- Git version control (professional)
- CI/CD quality gates (professional)
- Documentation (excellent)
- Testing (absent - gap)
- Versioning (absent - gap)
- Release management (absent - gap)

### Low Confidence (Requires Validation)

**User Adoption**: Unknown
- No telemetry or analytics detected
- GitHub stars/forks not queried
- Download metrics not available
- Usage statistics unknown

**Production Deployments**: Unknown
- Framework is distributed, not deployed
- Unknown how many projects use it
- Community size unclear

**Performance at Scale**: Not applicable
- Static documentation repository
- No runtime performance considerations
- Distribution performance is git-dependent

## Detailed Analysis

### Architecture Assessment

**Strengths**:
1. **Clear Separation of Concerns**:
   - Writing guide content separate from SDLC framework
   - Agents separate from commands separate from templates
   - Tools organized by function (agents/, install/, lint/, manifest/)

2. **Modular Design**:
   - Users can adopt writing guide only (minimal)
   - Users can adopt general agents only (writing focus)
   - Users can adopt SDLC framework only (development focus)
   - Users can adopt everything (complete framework)

3. **Extensibility**:
   - Agent template system (new agents follow pattern)
   - Command framework (slash commands for workflows)
   - Template library (SDLC artifacts)
   - Distribution automation (deploy to any project)

**Weaknesses**:
1. **No Versioning**:
   - Users can't pin to stable release
   - Breaking changes may occur without notice
   - No rollback mechanism for problematic updates

2. **Untested Tooling**:
   - No automated tests for deploy-agents.mjs
   - No automated tests for new-project.mjs
   - No automated tests for install.sh
   - Installation failures possible

3. **Single Point of Failure**:
   - Solo developer (Joseph Magly)
   - No peer review or second opinions
   - Bus factor = 1 (project at risk if developer unavailable)

### Infrastructure Assessment

**Strengths**:
1. **Automated Quality Gates**:
   - 10+ custom markdown linters
   - GitHub Actions CI enforcement
   - Manifest sync validation
   - Automated drift detection

2. **Self-Updating Distribution**:
   - aiwg CLI auto-updates on every command
   - Graceful error recovery (aiwg -reinstall)
   - Git-based distribution (no package manager complexity)

3. **Cross-Platform Support**:
   - Linux (apt-get, dnf, yum, pacman, zypper)
   - macOS (Homebrew)
   - WSL (Ubuntu on Windows)
   - Node.js version management (auto-install option)

**Weaknesses**:
1. **No Package Manager Distribution**:
   - Not on Homebrew (manual install only)
   - Not on apt repository
   - No npm package (script-based only)

2. **Limited Platform Testing**:
   - No CI matrix for multiple platforms
   - Manual testing only
   - Platform-specific bugs possible

3. **Supply Chain Risk**:
   - Installer downloads from GitHub (no signature verification)
   - No checksum validation
   - Trusts GitHub HTTPS only

### Security Assessment

**Posture**: Minimal (appropriate for documentation repository)

**Strengths**:
1. **No Secrets or Sensitive Data**:
   - Pure documentation and tooling
   - No API keys, passwords, or PII
   - Open source (transparency)

2. **User Permission Model**:
   - Installs to user directory (no sudo)
   - Shell aliases only (no system modifications)
   - Git-based (standard security model)

**Risks**:
1. **Supply Chain**:
   - Installer script runs arbitrary code from GitHub
   - No signature or checksum verification
   - MITM attack possible (mitigated by HTTPS)

2. **Auto-Update**:
   - aiwg auto-updates on every command
   - Malicious commit could affect all users
   - No version pinning option

**Mitigations**:
- GitHub HTTPS (TLS encryption)
- Open source code (community review possible)
- Git commit signatures (not detected, but available)

**Recommendations**:
- Add optional version pinning (aiwg -version-lock 1.0.0)
- Consider GPG signature for releases
- Add checksum verification for installer
- Document security model in SECURITY.md

### Team and Process Assessment

**Current State**:
- Solo developer (Joseph Magly)
- No formal process (rapid prototyping mode)
- Excellent documentation culture
- No testing culture yet

**Velocity**:
- Extremely high during active periods (70 commits/week)
- Sporadic activity (all 75 commits in last 3 months)
- Feature-focused (ROADMAP-driven development)

**Quality Culture**:
- Documentation-first (comprehensive guides)
- Quality automation (markdown linting)
- CI enforcement (GitHub Actions)
- But: No code testing, no peer review

**Recommendations**:
1. **Immediate**: Add semantic versioning (v1.0.0)
2. **Short-term**: Add basic smoke tests
3. **Medium-term**: Consider multi-contributor model (if community grows)
4. **Long-term**: Establish governance (if multiple active contributors)

## Confidence Levels Summary
