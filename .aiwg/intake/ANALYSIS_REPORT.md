## Evidence-Based Inferences

### Confident (Strong Evidence from Codebase)

✓ **Tech Stack**: Markdown content (485 files) + Node.js tools (22 .mjs scripts) + Bash installer
- Evidence: File counts, extensions analysis, tool implementations reviewed

✓ **Architecture**: Multi-component modular system
- Component 1: Writing guide content (core/, validation/, examples/, context/, patterns/)
- Component 2: SDLC framework (agentic/code/frameworks/sdlc-complete/ - 58 agents, 45 commands, 156 templates)
- Component 3: Tooling layer (tools/ - deploy, scaffold, lint, manifest management)
- Component 4: Distribution (install.sh, CLI registration, GitHub hosting)
- Evidence: Directory structure, manifest files, README documentation

✓ **Development Velocity**: Aggressive (35 commits/month, 1+ per day average)
- Evidence: Git log analysis (105 commits in 3 months, all from solo developer)

✓ **CI/CD Maturity**: Basic (GitHub Actions for linting, manifest validation)
- Evidence: .github/workflows/ (lint-fixcheck.yml, manifest-lint.yml, markdownlint.yml)

✓ **Documentation Quality**: Comprehensive
- Evidence: README.md, USAGE_GUIDE.md, AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, per-directory READMEs, manifest.md files

✓ **Open Source**: MIT license, public GitHub repository
- Evidence: LICENSE file, GitHub remote URL

### Inferred (Reasonable Assumptions from Patterns)

⚠️ **Team Size**: Solo developer currently, planning 2-3 within 6 months
- Evidence: Single git contributor (Joseph Magly), user response confirming solo short-term + team expansion plan

⚠️ **Process Maturity**: Medium (comprehensive docs, CI/CD present, but manual testing, no PR reviews)
- Evidence: Extensive documentation + GitHub Actions, but no test files detected, solo developer self-review

⚠️ **Business Model**: Undecided (community vs commercial vs personal tool depends on traction)
- Evidence: Open source + MIT license (permissive), user response indicating undecided path

⚠️ **Primary Audience**: Technical users (developers, SRE/eng teams, agentic coding users)
- Evidence: SDLC terminology, agent-based workflows, enterprise patterns, technical documentation depth

⚠️ **Target Projects**: Team projects (3-10 devs, 10k-100k LoC, months to ship) initially, enterprise (10+ devs) eventually
- Evidence: User response + enterprise SRE/eng background, framework supports "smallest to largest applications"

### Clarified by User (Interactive Questions)

✓ **Priority Focus**: SDLC framework is critical path (writing guide can iterate slower)
- Source: Question 1 response

✓ **Ship Criteria**: Ship now - already usable, iterate based on feedback
- Source: Question 2 response

✓ **Trade-offs**: Accepting manual testing only (30-50% coverage), self-improvement tooling focus
- Source: Question 3 response

✓ **Framework Scope**: Modular - users compose subsets based on project type (not full framework load)
- Source: Question 4 response

✓ **Pivot Triggers**: User testing wrong assumptions, performance/scale issues at small usage
- Source: Question 5 response

✓ **Intent**: Undecided path (community vs commercial vs personal tool depends on traction)
- Source: Question 6 response

✓ **10x Growth Limit**: Support capacity (solo developer can't handle 100 issues/week, need self-service + PR automation)
- Source: Question 7 response

✓ **Self-Application Stage**: Early/experimental (just starting to apply framework to itself)
- Source: Question 8 response

✓ **Team Plans**: Solo short-term, 2-3 contributors within 6 months
- Source: Question 9 response

✓ **User Entry Point**: Direct to install (already convinced, want to use)
- Source: Question 10 response

✓ **Target Project Range**: Team projects (3-10 devs) primary, enterprise (10+ devs) eventual
- Source: Question 11 response

### Unknown (Insufficient Evidence, Marked for Follow-up)

❓ **Active User Count**: 0 currently (pre-launch), 2-5 user testing target (2-4 weeks)
- Clarification: User confirmed pre-launch status, planning small user testing cohort

❓ **Performance Baselines**: Tools fast (<5s observed), but no formal benchmarks
- Follow-up: Add performance monitoring if user testing reveals issues (pivot trigger)

❓ **Multi-Platform Demand**: Currently Claude Code-focused, OpenAI/Codex potential if user requests
- Follow-up: Monitor user requests for platform expansion, defer abstraction until demand validates

## Confidence Levels

- **High Confidence**: 12 inferences (direct codebase evidence: tech stack, architecture, velocity, docs, CI/CD, license)
- **Medium Confidence**: 5 inferences (patterns + user responses: team size, maturity, audience, target projects, business model)
- **User-Validated**: 11 clarifications (interactive questions: priority, ship criteria, trade-offs, scope, pivots, intent, limits, self-app, team, entry, range)
- **Unknown**: 3 gaps (active users, performance baselines, multi-platform demand - monitoring/deferring)

## Quality Assessment

### Strengths

✓ **Comprehensive content**: 485 markdown files (writing guides, SDLC templates, examples, context docs)
✓ **Modular design**: Users load subsets for project type (personal scripts to enterprise systems)
✓ **Extensive framework**: 58 agents, 45 commands, 156 templates (full SDLC lifecycle coverage)
✓ **Strong documentation**: README, USAGE_GUIDE, AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, per-directory READMEs, manifests
✓ **CI/CD automation**: GitHub Actions for markdown linting, manifest validation
✓ **Self-improvement focus**: Framework used to build/manage itself, generated docs vs chat logs
✓ **Enterprise background**: 30 years SRE/eng experience, deep SDLC knowledge, eventual enterprise usage planned

### Weaknesses

⚠️ **No automated tests**: 0% test coverage (manual testing only, accepting 30-50% short-term)
⚠️ **Solo developer constraints**: Velocity high (1+ commit/day) but support capacity limited (can't scale to 100 issues/week)
⚠️ **Early self-application**: Framework not yet fully self-hosted (early/experimental stage, needs maturation)
⚠️ **Potential documentation complexity**: Comprehensive docs may be too complex for non-experts (need beginner paths if user testing reveals)
⚠️ **Technical debt acceptance**: Prioritizing features over refactoring short-term (will clean up post-user-validation)
⚠️ **No multi-platform abstraction yet**: Currently Claude Code-specific (may need OpenAI/Codex layer if demand grows)

## Recommendations

### Immediate (0-4 weeks)

1. **Complete user testing**: Recruit 2-5 users, validate core workflows (install, deploy, scaffold, usage)
2. **Add smoke tests**: Critical paths (deploy-agents.mjs, new-project.mjs, install.sh) to prevent regression
3. **Monitor pivot triggers**: User feedback (workflow confusion), performance (CLI execution time), multi-platform requests
4. **Self-application iteration**: Use `flow-iteration-dual-track` for next development cycle, document learnings

### Short-term (1-3 months)

1. **Team expansion**: Onboard 2nd contributor (use `flow-team-onboarding`), establish PR review process
2. **Testing maturity**: Increase to 60-80% automated test coverage (unit tests for tools/, integration tests for workflows)
3. **Process adoption**: Formal SDLC workflows (`flow-iteration-dual-track`, `project-status`, ADRs for major decisions)
4. **Multi-platform exploration**: If user demand validates, prototype OpenAI/Codex abstraction layer

### Long-term (6-12 months)

Depends on traction path chosen:

**If Community**:
1. **Self-service infrastructure**: FAQs, GitHub Discussions, issue templates, PR automation
2. **Self-improvement loops**: Automated PR acceptance for docs, linting fixes, manifest updates
3. **Community governance**: Contributor guidelines, code of conduct, maintainer team

**If Enterprise**:
1. **Compliance documentation**: SOC2, ISO27001, HIPAA patterns for regulated industries
2. **Support SLAs**: Issue response time commitments (48hr response, 1-week critical fixes)
3. **Enterprise templates**: Audit trails, change control, traceability for compliance

**If Personal Tool**:
1. **Stability milestone**: Framework mature, low-maintenance (1-2 hours/week upkeep)
2. **Clear boundaries**: Communication that no support provided, use at own risk
3. **Complete self-application**: All own projects use framework successfully

## Key Insights for SDLC Application

### What Makes This Project Unique

1. **Meta-Framework**: Tooling designed to build/manage itself (self-improvement loops core to design)
2. **Modular Philosophy**: Comprehensive (58 agents, 45 commands) but users load subsets (project-type-specific)
3. **Documentation as Product**: Generated docs superior to chat logs (audit trails, decision records, process clarity)
4. **Velocity Prioritization**: Ship-now mindset (already usable), iterating based on feedback, accepting imperfections
5. **Enterprise Foundation, MVP Execution**: 30 years SRE/eng background, but ship fast now, mature over time

### Framework Application Strategy

**Current (Minimal Rigor)**:
- Intake: ✓ Complete (this process)
- Testing: Smoke tests only (critical paths)
- Workflows: `flow-iteration-dual-track` (self-application)
- Tracking: `project-status` (milestone progress)
- Agents: writing-validator, code-reviewer (selective)

**Evolution (3 months → Moderate Rigor)**:
- Team: 2-3 contributors, PR reviews
- Testing: 60-80% automated coverage
- Workflows: Formal iterations, ADRs for major decisions
- Templates: Basic architecture docs (SAD if stable)

**Future (6-12 months → Full/Enterprise Rigor)**:
- Path-dependent: Community (self-service, PR automation) vs Enterprise (compliance, SLAs) vs Personal (stable, no support)
- Decision point: Traction from user testing determines path
