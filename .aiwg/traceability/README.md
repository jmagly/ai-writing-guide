# Requirements Traceability Matrix

**Purpose**: Maintain end-to-end traceability from requirements through architecture, code, and tests to expose gaps early and ensure comprehensive coverage.

**Status**: BASELINED (Elaboration Week 4)
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-19
**Coverage**: 100% (58/58 requirements traced)

---

## Overview

The Requirements Traceability Matrix tracks all project requirements and their relationships to:
- **Architecture Components**: Which components implement each requirement
- **Test Cases**: Which tests validate each requirement
- **Implementation Status**: Pending, In Progress, Complete
- **Verification Status**: Pending, Pass, Fail
- **Priority**: P0 (Make-or-Break), P1 (High Value), P2 (Nice-to-Have)

## Usage

### Viewing the Matrix

**Spreadsheet Application** (Excel, Google Sheets, LibreOffice Calc):
```bash
# Open CSV in your preferred spreadsheet application
open .aiwg/traceability/requirements-traceability-matrix.csv
```

**Command Line** (grep, awk):
```bash
# Find all P0 requirements
grep ",P0," .aiwg/traceability/requirements-traceability-matrix.csv

# Count requirements by priority
grep -c ",P0," .aiwg/traceability/requirements-traceability-matrix.csv
grep -c ",P1," .aiwg/traceability/requirements-traceability-matrix.csv
grep -c ",P2," .aiwg/traceability/requirements-traceability-matrix.csv

# Find requirements for specific component
grep "CoreOrchestrator" .aiwg/traceability/requirements-traceability-matrix.csv

# Find requirements with specific test case
grep "TC-FSI-001" .aiwg/traceability/requirements-traceability-matrix.csv
```

**Future Automation** (FID-001: Traceability Automation):
```bash
# Check traceability coverage (future command)
/project:check-traceability .aiwg/traceability/requirements-traceability-matrix.csv

# Expected output:
# ✓ Requirements-to-Component Coverage: 100% (58/58)
# ✓ Requirements-to-Test Coverage: 100% (58/58)
# ✓ Orphan Requirements: 0
# ✓ Orphan Components: 0
# ✓ All traceability checks passed
```

## Maintenance

### Update Frequency

**During Elaboration Phase** (Weeks 1-4):
- Update after each requirements workshop
- Update when new use cases elaborated
- Update when NFRs extracted

**During Construction Phase** (Weeks 1-8):
- Update when implementation status changes (Pending → In Progress → Complete)
- Update when test verification completes (Pending → Pass/Fail)
- Update when architecture refactoring occurs (component renames, merges, splits)

**During Transition Phase** (Weeks 1-4):
- Update when production deployment completes
- Update when acceptance testing completes
- Final traceability audit before Product Release milestone

### Update Process

1. **Identify Change**: New requirement, architecture change, test case added
2. **Update CSV**: Edit requirements-traceability-matrix.csv directly
3. **Validate**: Run validation checks (manual or automated)
4. **Document**: Create traceability update report in `.aiwg/working/`
5. **Review**: Requirements Analyst + Architecture Designer review
6. **Commit**: Commit CSV and report to version control
