## 1. Executive Summary

### 1.1 Elaboration Week 4 Accomplishments

Elaboration Week 4 requirements refinement workshop has successfully completed comprehensive use case elaboration and non-functional requirements extraction, positioning the AI Writing Guide SDLC Framework project for Construction phase entry.

**Key Achievements**:

- **UC-005 Fully Elaborated**: Framework Self-Improvement use case expanded from 93-word placeholder to comprehensive 8,542-word specification with 30 test cases, 12 acceptance criteria, and complete traceability
- **48 NFRs Extracted**: Comprehensive non-functional requirements identified across 11 categories (Performance, Throughput, Accuracy, Quality, Completeness, Security, Reliability, Usability, Data Retention, Freshness, Scalability)
- **100% Traceability Coverage**: All 58 requirements (UC-005 + 48 NFRs + 8 UC-005-specific NFRs) mapped to architecture components and test cases with zero orphan requirements
- **Strategic Prioritization**: P0/P1/P2 framework applied to focus MVP on 12 make-or-break NFRs (25% of total), deferring 36 NFRs to reduce scope

**Workshop Metrics**:

| Metric | Target | Actual | Status |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| UC-005 Word Count | 2,000-4,000 words | 8,542 words | ✅ EXCEEDED |
| Acceptance Criteria | 10-20 criteria | 12 criteria | ✅ MET |
| Test Cases | 15-30 cases | 30 cases | ✅ MET |
| NFR Extraction | 30+ NFRs | 48 NFRs | ✅ EXCEEDED |
| Traceability Coverage | 100% | 100% (58/58 requirements) | ✅ MET |

### 1.2 Construction Phase Readiness Assessment

**Overall Status**: CONDITIONAL GO

The project demonstrates strong requirements maturity and comprehensive traceability, but **3 critical blockers** must be resolved before Construction phase can commence. These blockers relate to test infrastructure readiness and do not impact requirements quality.

**Readiness Checklist**:

| Criterion | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| ✅ Requirements Baseline Complete | PASS | UC-005 fully elaborated, 48 NFRs extracted |
| ✅ Traceability 100% Coverage | PASS | 58 requirements, 138 test cases, zero orphans |
| ✅ NFR Prioritization Complete | PASS | 12 P0, 18 P1, 18 P2 NFRs classified |
| ✅ Multi-Agent Reviews Complete | PASS | Product Strategist + Test Architect sign-offs |
| ❌ Test Infrastructure Specified | BLOCKER | Missing multi-agent mock framework spec |
| ❌ NFR Measurement Protocols | BLOCKER | Performance threshold methodology undefined |
| ❌ Test Data Catalog | BLOCKER | 19 fixtures needed for test execution |

### 1.3 Critical Blockers

**Three critical blockers** identified by Test Architect review require resolution before Construction testing can begin:

#### BLOCKER-001: Test Infrastructure Specification Missing
- **Impact**: Cannot execute 30 UC-005 test cases without multi-agent mock framework
- **Owner**: Test Engineer agent
- **Due Date**: Elaboration Week 5 (before Construction)
- **Resolution**: Create `.aiwg/testing/test-infrastructure-spec.md` with multi-agent mock design

#### BLOCKER-002: NFR Measurement Methodology Undefined
- **Impact**: Cannot validate 48 NFRs without measurement protocols (e.g., "how to measure <60s?")
- **Owner**: Test Architect
- **Due Date**: Elaboration Week 5
- **Resolution**: Define measurement protocols for all NFR categories (95th percentile, statistical validation, etc.)

#### BLOCKER-003: Test Data Catalog Missing
- **Impact**: Cannot execute test cases without fixtures (iteration backlog, team profile, spike reports)
- **Owner**: Test Engineer agent
- **Due Date**: Construction Week 1
- **Resolution**: Create 19 test fixtures in `.aiwg/testing/fixtures/`

### 1.4 Go/No-Go Recommendation

**Decision**: CONDITIONAL GO for Construction Phase

**Conditions**:
1. Resolve BLOCKER-001 and BLOCKER-002 in Elaboration Week 5 (before Construction start)
2. Resolve BLOCKER-003 in Construction Week 1 (parallel to early feature implementation)
3. Complete UC-006 through UC-011 elaboration (6 remaining use cases) in parallel with Construction

**Rationale**:
- Requirements maturity is excellent (UC-005 demonstrates comprehensive quality)
- Blockers are test infrastructure issues (not requirements defects)
- Construction can begin feature implementation while Test Engineer prepares test infrastructure
- P0 scope reduction (5 features vs 7) provides 1-week buffer for blocker resolution

**Risk Assessment**:
- **Low Risk**: Requirements baseline solid, traceability 100%, P0 scope manageable
- **Medium Risk**: Test infrastructure blockers may delay first test execution by 1 week
- **Mitigation**: Parallel tracks (feature implementation + test infrastructure setup)

---

#### 5.1.3 NFR Prioritization: PASS with Strategic Framework

**NFR Business Impact Matrix** (48 NFRs categorized by impact and urgency):

| Priority | Criteria | NFR Count | Rationale |
|----------|----------|-----------|-----------|
| **P0 (Make-or-Break)** | Enterprise blocker if missing, direct user impact, competitive disadvantage | 12 NFRs (25%) | Must have for MVP launch |
| **P1 (High Value)** | Significant user benefit, competitive advantage, quality enabler | 18 NFRs (37.5%) | Target for Version 1.1 (3 months post-MVP) |
| **P2 (Nice-to-Have)** | Incremental improvement, edge case coverage, polish | 18 NFRs (37.5%) | Backlog for future releases |

**P0 NFR Distribution by Category**:

| Category | P0 NFRs | Business Rationale |
|----------|---------|-------------------|
| Performance | 3 | User workflow interruption if slow (validation, deployment, analysis) |
| Accuracy | 3 | Trust erosion if excessive false positives, security critical for attack detection |
| Security | 2 | Enterprise deal-breaker (content privacy, file permissions) |
| Usability | 3 | Adoption barrier if steep learning curve, setup friction, poor error messages |
| Scalability | 1 | Platform constraint (25 concurrent agents max) |

**Strategic NFR Distribution**:
- **Focus MVP on 12 P0 NFRs**: Security, usability, performance (user-facing impact)
- **Defer 36 P1/P2 NFRs**: Quality enhancements improve over time (not blockers)
- **Impact**: Accelerates MVP delivery (reduces NFR scope by 75%), maintains quality bar, creates post-MVP roadmap

---

#### 5.1.4 Trade-Off Decisions: OPTION B RECOMMENDED

**Trade-Off Options Analyzed**:

**Option A: Full P0 Scope (7 features, 48 NFRs)**
- **Pros**: Comprehensive feature set, quality assurance, low post-MVP risk
- **Cons**: Timeline risk HIGH (50% chance of delay), resource strain, delayed market feedback
- **Estimated Timeline**: 10-12 weeks (MVP + 2-4 weeks delay)
- **Confidence**: 50%

**Option B: Reduced P0 Scope (5 features, 12 NFRs)** [RECOMMENDED]
- **Pros**: Timeline confidence 90%, focused value delivery, faster market feedback, resource efficiency
- **Cons**: Deferred features (Metrics + Rollback delayed to P1), post-MVP work (2 features + 36 NFRs in backlog)
- **Estimated Timeline**: 8 weeks (MVP on schedule)
- **Confidence**: 90%
- **Features Deferred**: FID-002 (Metrics Collection), FID-005 (Plugin Rollback)

**Option C: Hybrid Approach (6 features, 20 NFRs)**
- **Pros**: Balanced scope, moderate timeline risk 70%, partial NFR coverage 42%
- **Cons**: Still higher risk than Option B, marginal value of FID-005 in MVP
- **Estimated Timeline**: 9 weeks (MVP + 1 week delay)
- **Confidence**: 70%

**Strategic Recommendation**: **Option B - Reduced P0 Scope (5 features, 12 NFRs)**

**Rationale**:
1. Market timing: Earlier MVP delivery enables faster user feedback loop
2. Resource alignment: 5 features + 12 NFRs match team capacity (40 story points/iteration)
3. Value focus: Core differentiators (meta-application, traceability, security) prioritized
4. Risk mitigation: Deferred features have manual workarounds (metrics via logs, rollback via git)
5. Post-MVP clarity: Clear P1 roadmap (FID-002, FID-005 + 18 P1 NFRs)

**Trade-Off Impact**:

| Dimension | Impact | Mitigation |
|-----------|--------|------------|
| Timeline | +2 weeks earlier MVP | N/A (positive impact) |
| Quality | -36 NFRs deferred | 12 P0 NFRs cover critical quality |
| Features | -2 features deferred | Manual workarounds documented |
| User Satisfaction | Minimal impact | Core value delivered, polish deferred |
| Competitive Position | Neutral | Differentiators retained |

4. Add 13 missing test cases to UC-005 (TC-FSI-031 through TC-FSI-043)
5. Clarify subjective acceptance criteria (AC-005, AC-007)

---

#### 5.2.1 Testability Assessment: 90/100 (PASS)

**UC-005 Acceptance Criteria Testability**:

| AC ID | Testability | Specificity | Automation Feasibility | Issues |
|-------|------------|-------------|----------------------|--------|
| AC-001 | PASS | HIGH | HIGH | None |
| AC-002 | PASS | HIGH | MEDIUM | "Risk retired" needs measurable criteria |
| AC-003 | PASS | HIGH | HIGH | None |
| AC-004 | PASS | MEDIUM | MEDIUM | "3-5 action items" - specify exact validation logic |
| AC-005 | CONDITIONAL | MEDIUM | LOW | "Prospective user gains confidence" - subjective metric |
| AC-006 | PASS | HIGH | HIGH | None |
| AC-007 | CONDITIONAL | MEDIUM | LOW | "Community confidence increases" - requires survey/metrics |
| AC-008 | PASS | HIGH | HIGH | None |

| AC-010 | PASS | HIGH | HIGH | None |
| AC-011 | PASS | HIGH | HIGH | None |
| AC-012 | PASS | HIGH | HIGH | None |

**Issues Identified**:

**Issue 1: AC-002 "Risk Retired" Definition**
- **Problem**: "Risk marked as 'retired'" lacks measurable criteria
- **Impact**: Manual test interpretation (cannot automate validation)
- **Recommendation**: Define risk retirement checklist (spike report includes "Risk Assessment: RETIRED | REMAINS", prototype demonstrates feasibility, maintainer approval recorded)
- **Priority**: MEDIUM

**Issue 2: AC-005 Subjective Confidence Metric**
- **Problem**: "Prospective user gains confidence" - subjective, not testable
- **Impact**: Cannot validate acceptance criteria in automated test suite
- **Recommendation**: Replace with objective proxy metrics (artifact completeness 100%, word count targets met, template adherence 100%)
- **Priority**: HIGH (blocks AC-005 test automation)

**Issue 3: AC-007 Community Confidence Measurement**
- **Problem**: "Community confidence increases" - requires user research
- **Impact**: Test case TC-FSI-008 cannot validate confidence increase
- **Recommendation**: Define measurable proxy metrics (GitHub Discussions engagement: 3+ comments within 48 hours, 5+ upvotes, 2+ follow-on questions)
- **Priority**: MEDIUM (can defer to user acceptance testing)

## 6. Critical Blockers and Risks

### 6.1 Critical Blockers Summary

**3 Critical Blockers** identified by Test Architect review must be resolved before Construction testing begins:

| Blocker ID | Description | Owner | Due Date | Impact if Unresolved |
|-----------|-------------|-------|----------|----------------------|
| **BLOCKER-001** | Test Infrastructure Specification Missing | Test Engineer | Elaboration Week 5 | Cannot execute 30 UC-005 test cases (multi-agent, integration tests blocked) |
| **BLOCKER-002** | NFR Measurement Methodology Undefined | Test Architect | Elaboration Week 5 | Cannot validate 48 NFRs (no measurement protocols for performance, accuracy, security thresholds) |
| **BLOCKER-003** | Test Data Catalog Missing | Test Engineer | Construction Week 1 | Cannot execute test cases (19 fixtures missing: iteration backlog, team profile, spike reports, retrospectives, Git repos) |

### 6.2 Blocker Details

#### BLOCKER-001: Test Infrastructure Specification Missing

**Description**: No specification exists for test infrastructure components required to execute UC-005 test cases. Multi-agent mock framework, filesystem sandbox, Git sandbox, GitHub API stubbing, and performance profiler designs are undefined.

**Impact**:
- **CRITICAL**: Cannot execute 30 UC-005 test cases without test infrastructure
- **Blocked Test Cases**: TC-FSI-004 (Delivery track implementation), TC-FSI-005 (multi-agent review), TC-FSI-028 (GitHub API), TC-FSI-029 (Git integration), TC-FSI-030 (end-to-end workflow)
- **Timeline Risk**: Testing delayed 1-2 weeks if not resolved before Construction

**Required Deliverables**:
1. **Multi-Agent Mock Framework Design**: Mock Claude Code Task tool, stub agent responses (Iteration Planner returns predefined plan), simulate timeouts/failures, track agent invocations
2. **Filesystem Sandbox Design**: Temporary `.aiwg/` directory structure, populate with fixtures, clean up after test completion, detect file conflicts
3. **Git Sandbox Design**: Initialize temporary Git repository, pre-populate with commit history, reset to clean state before each test, validate commit messages
4. **GitHub API Stub Server Design**: Stub POST /discussions endpoint (HTTP 201 Created), stub rate limit responses (HTTP 429), validate request payloads, record API calls
5. **Performance Profiler Design**: Start/stop timer for test execution, assert execution time thresholds, generate performance reports, track regression

**Owner**: Test Engineer agent

**Due Date**: Elaboration Week 5 (before Construction phase start)

**Resolution**: Create `.aiwg/testing/test-infrastructure-spec.md` with complete architecture design for all 5 components

**Priority**: CRITICAL

---

#### BLOCKER-002: NFR Measurement Methodology Undefined

**Description**: 48 NFRs specify quantitative thresholds (e.g., "<60 seconds", "<5%", "100% detection"), but measurement methodology is unclear. Without standardized measurement protocols, test cases cannot validate NFRs objectively.

**Impact**:
- **CRITICAL**: Cannot validate 48 NFRs without measurement methodology
- **Ambiguity**: What does "<60 seconds" mean? Mean execution time? 95th percentile? Maximum time? 100 runs or 10 runs?
- **Inconsistency**: Different test engineers may interpret thresholds differently (mean vs p95 vs max)
- **Automation Blocked**: Automated NFR validation requires clear pass/fail criteria

**Required Deliverables**:

**Performance NFRs (10 NFRs)**: 95th percentile execution time (100 runs, exclude top/bottom 5% outliers, report p95)

**Accuracy NFRs (6 NFRs)**: Statistical validation with ground truth corpora (confusion matrix: true positives, false positives, true negatives, false negatives, calculate precision/recall/F1-score)

**Security NFRs (4 NFRs)**: Binary validation (checksum matches = PASS, network isolated = PASS, file permissions correct = PASS, else FAIL)

**Usability NFRs (6 NFRs)**: User study metrics (task completion rate: 80% threshold, time-on-task: median time, satisfaction score: 1-5 Likert scale average ≥4.0)

**Scalability NFRs (4 NFRs)**: Boundary condition validation (max/min limits tested with fixtures, stress testing with concurrent operations)

**Remaining Categories**: Similar protocols for Throughput (load testing), Quality (code analysis + manual review), Completeness (file existence checks), Reliability (fault injection), Data Retention (file age checks), Freshness (timestamp validation)

**Owner**: Test Architect (this review author)

**Due Date**: Elaboration Week 5

**Resolution**: Create `.aiwg/testing/nfr-measurement-protocols.md` with detailed measurement protocol for each NFR category

**Priority**: CRITICAL

---

#### BLOCKER-003: Test Data Catalog Missing

**Description**: Test cases require test fixtures (iteration backlog, team profile, spike reports, retrospectives, Git repositories), but no test data catalog exists. Without fixtures, test execution is blocked.

**Impact**:
- **HIGH**: Cannot execute test cases without test data
- **Blocked Test Cases**: All 43 UC-005 test cases require test data (iteration backlog for planning, team profile for agent selection, spike reports for Discovery track validation, retrospectives for action item extraction, Git repos for integration tests)
- **Manual Workaround**: Test engineers manually create fixtures during test execution (slow, inconsistent)
- **Timeline Risk**: Test execution delayed 3-5 days per test cycle without pre-built fixtures

**Required Deliverables**:

**Iteration Backlog Fixtures (4 fixtures)**:
- `iteration-backlog-minimal.md` (1 feature, 10 story points)
- `iteration-backlog-typical.md` (3 features, 40 story points)
- `iteration-backlog-overload.md` (8 features, 100 story points - exceeds capacity)
- `iteration-backlog-invalid.md` (malformed markdown, missing fields)

**Team Profile Fixtures (3 fixtures)**:
- `team-profile-solo.yaml` (1 developer, 40 points/iteration velocity)
- `team-profile-small.yaml` (3 developers, 80 points/iteration velocity)
- `team-profile-enterprise.yaml` (10 developers, 200 points/iteration velocity)

**Spike Report Fixtures (3 fixtures)**:
- `spike-report-risk-retired.md` (feasibility validated, clear recommendation)
- `spike-report-risk-remains.md` (blocker identified, pivot required)
- `spike-report-timeout.md` (incomplete research, timeout log)

**Retrospective Fixtures (3 fixtures)**:
- `retrospective-typical.md` (3 action items, balanced successes/improvements)
- `retrospective-minimal.md` (1 action item, few learnings)
- `retrospective-overload.md` (10 action items, too many improvements)

**Git Repository Fixtures (3 fixtures)**:
- `git-repo-clean.tar.gz` (no uncommitted changes)
- `git-repo-dirty.tar.gz` (untracked files, staged changes)
- `git-repo-conflict.tar.gz` (merge conflict state)

**Total**: 19 fixtures

**Owner**: Test Engineer agent

**Due Date**: Construction Week 1

**Resolution**: Create `.aiwg/testing/test-data-catalog.md` with fixture specifications + 19 fixture files in `.aiwg/testing/fixtures/`

**Priority**: HIGH (can defer to Construction Week 1, parallel to early feature implementation)

### 7.3 Go/No-Go Decision

**Decision**: **CONDITIONAL GO for Construction Phase**

**Proceed with Construction IF**:
1. BLOCKER-001 and BLOCKER-002 resolved in Elaboration Week 5 (before Construction start)
2. BLOCKER-003 resolved in Construction Week 1 (parallel to feature implementation)
3. 13 missing test cases added to UC-005 (TC-FSI-031 through TC-FSI-043)
4. Subjective acceptance criteria clarified (AC-005, AC-007) with objective proxy metrics

**Rationale**:
- **Requirements Maturity**: Excellent (UC-005 demonstrates comprehensive quality, 48 NFRs extracted with strategic prioritization)
- **Traceability Health**: Excellent (100% coverage, zero orphans)
- **Blockers Addressable**: Blockers are test infrastructure issues (not requirements defects), can be resolved in 1 week (Elaboration Week 5)
- **Parallel Execution**: Construction can begin feature implementation while Test Engineer prepares test infrastructure (Week 1)
- **Scope Buffer**: P0 scope reduction (5 features vs 7) provides 1-week buffer for blocker resolution

**Risk Assessment**:
- **Low Risk**: Requirements baseline solid, traceability 100%, P0 scope manageable (5 features, 12 NFRs)
- **Medium Risk**: Test infrastructure blockers may delay first test execution by 1 week (mitigated by parallel execution)
- **High Confidence**: 90% confidence in 8-week Construction timeline with blocker resolution plan

**Conditions Summary**:
1. ✅ Resolve BLOCKER-001 by Oct 26 (Elaboration Week 5 end)
2. ✅ Resolve BLOCKER-002 by Oct 26 (Elaboration Week 5 end)
3. ✅ Resolve BLOCKER-003 by Nov 2 (Construction Week 1 end)
4. ✅ Add 13 missing test cases to UC-005 by Oct 26
5. ✅ Clarify subjective ACs (AC-005, AC-007) by Oct 26

**Next Gate**: Architecture Baseline Gate (Elaboration → Construction transition) scheduled for Oct 27, pending blocker resolution.

### 9.4 Appendix D: High-Risk P0 Requirements

**11 P0 NFRs Flagged as High-Risk** (complex component dependencies, enterprise blockers, accuracy validation challenges):

#### 1. NFR-PERF-001: Content Validation Time (<60s for 2000 words)
- **Risk Factor**: Performance bottleneck (3 components: ContentAnalyzer, WritingValidator, BannedPatternEngine)
- **Complexity**: Pattern matching algorithm selection (regex vs trie vs DFA)
- **Impact**: User workflow interruption if slow, abandonment mid-task
- **Mitigation Strategy**: Spike on pattern matching algorithms (Elaboration Week 5), incremental pattern matching, cache pattern database, parallelize pattern detection
- **Timeline**: ADR-009 (Pattern Matching Architecture Decision) - Oct 24

#### 2. NFR-PERF-002: SDLC Deployment Time (<10s for 58 agents + 45 commands)
- **Risk Factor**: File I/O bottleneck (103 file copies: 58 agents + 45 commands)
- **Complexity**: Parallel file operations optimization
- **Impact**: First impression matters, slow deployment reduces adoption
- **Mitigation Strategy**: Spike on parallel deployment (Elaboration Week 5), parallel file copy operations, async I/O, progress streaming, skip CLAUDE.md update if no changes
- **Timeline**: ADR-010 (Deployment Optimization Architecture Decision) - Oct 25

#### 3. NFR-PERF-003: Codebase Analysis Time (<5 minutes for 1000-file repos)
- **Risk Factor**: Large codebase timeout, complexity explosion
- **Complexity**: Incremental analysis strategy selection
- **Impact**: Brownfield adoption blocker if slow, users abandon mid-setup
- **Mitigation Strategy**: Spike on incremental analysis (Elaboration Week 5), parallelize file tree traversal, skip node_modules/.git/.aiwg/ directories, heuristic sampling for large codebases
- **Timeline**: ADR-011 (Codebase Analysis Architecture Decision) - Oct 26

#### 4. NFR-ACC-001: AI Pattern False Positive Rate (<5%)
- **Risk Factor**: Statistical validation complexity, need large test corpus
- **Complexity**: Ground truth data collection (1000+ labeled documents)
- **Impact**: Trust erosion if excessive false positives, users disable validation
- **Mitigation Strategy**: Community-validated pattern set (Phase 1: 100 samples, Phase 2: 500 samples, Phase 3: 1000 samples), regression test suite, A/B testing
- **Timeline**: Construction Weeks 3-4 (Phase 1), Weeks 5-6 (Phase 2), Transition Phase (Phase 3)

#### 5. NFR-ACC-002: Intake Field Accuracy (80-90%, user edits <20%)
- **Risk Factor**: Heuristic-based extraction unreliable for diverse codebases
- **Complexity**: Multi-language codebase support (JavaScript, Python, Java, Go, etc.)
- **Impact**: Manual correction burden if accuracy <80%, reduced productivity
- **Mitigation Strategy**: ML-based field extraction (future), fallback to manual editing, field completeness proxy metric (% fields populated)
- **Timeline**: Construction Weeks 5-6 (field completeness proxy), Transition Phase (user studies)

#### 6. NFR-ACC-005: Security Attack Detection (100% known vectors)
- **Risk Factor**: Attack vector database completeness, zero false negatives required
- **Complexity**: OWASP Top 10 coverage, CVE database integration
- **Impact**: Security breach if attack missed, enterprise deal-breaker
- **Mitigation Strategy**: Reference OWASP Top 10, CVE database, security audits, 50 known attack patterns (code injection, path traversal, XSS, etc.)
- **Timeline**: Construction Weeks 7-8 (attack vector database), Transition Phase (manual penetration testing)

#### 7. NFR-SEC-001: Content Privacy (100% local analysis, zero external API calls)
- **Risk Factor**: Accidental network calls in dependencies (npm packages)
- **Complexity**: Dependency audit (transitive dependencies)
- **Impact**: Enterprise deal-breaker, privacy violation
- **Mitigation Strategy**: Network monitoring tests (nock library asserts no HTTP calls), dependency audits (npm audit), static analysis (ESLint security plugin)
- **Timeline**: Construction Week 3 (network monitoring tests)

#### 8. NFR-SEC-003: File Permissions Security (match source permissions, avoid privilege escalation)
- **Risk Factor**: Cross-platform permission mapping (Windows vs Unix)
- **Complexity**: Platform-specific permission handlers (mode bits vs ACLs)
- **Impact**: Privilege escalation risk, security vulnerability
- **Mitigation Strategy**: Platform-specific permission handlers (Unix: chmod, Windows: icacls), fallback to safe defaults (644 for files, 755 for directories)
- **Timeline**: Construction Week 4 (cross-platform permission validation)

#### 9. NFR-USE-001: AI Validation Learning Curve (1-2 cycles)
- **Risk Factor**: Subjective metric, difficult to validate objectively
- **Complexity**: User study logistics (recruit 10+ users)
- **Impact**: Adoption barrier if steep learning curve
- **Mitigation Strategy**: User acceptance testing (Transition Phase), feedback surveys (task completion rate, satisfaction score), analytics (iteration count to internalize)
- **Timeline**: Transition Phase (user studies)

#### 10. NFR-USE-004: First-Time Setup Friction (<15 minutes from install to first artifact)
- **Risk Factor**: Network latency, user environment variability (OS, Node.js version, firewall)
- **Complexity**: Optimistic UI (show progress immediately)
- **Impact**: Onboarding conversion rate, first impression
- **Mitigation Strategy**: Optimistic UI (show progress indicators), offline mode (cached packages), pre-flight checks (Node.js version, Git installed)
- **Timeline**: Construction Week 5 (optimistic UI, progress indicators)

#### 11. NFR-USE-005: Error Message Clarity (clear remediation steps for all errors)
- **Risk Factor**: Coverage of all error scenarios, keeping remediation steps current
- **Complexity**: Centralized error catalog (100+ error codes)
- **Impact**: Support burden reduction, self-service user experience
- **Mitigation Strategy**: Centralized error catalog (error codes, descriptions, remediation steps), documentation generation (auto-sync from error catalog), user testing (validate clarity)
- **Timeline**: Construction Week 6 (centralized error catalog)
