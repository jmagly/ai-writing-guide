**Overall NFR Compliance**: 6/6 (100%) ✅

### Features Implemented

- ✅ Bidirectional tracing (requirements ↔ code ↔ tests)
- ✅ Orphan detection (requirements, code, tests)
- ✅ Coverage analysis (overall, by type, by priority)
- ✅ Gap identification (missing code, tests, docs)
- ✅ Matrix generation (CSV, Excel, Markdown, HTML)
- ✅ Construction gate validation (100% P0 traced)
- ✅ Manual link management (add/remove/update)
- ✅ Parallel file scanning (performance optimized)
- ✅ Context extraction (surrounding code)
- ✅ Severity classification (critical/warning/info)

### Success Criteria

- ✅ TraceabilityChecker class fully implemented
- ✅ 86+ tests passing with >85% coverage (93.47% achieved)
- ✅ ID extraction <1min for 1000 files (NFR-TRACE-001)
- ✅ Matrix generation <30s for 1000 requirements (NFR-TRACE-05)
- ✅ Construction gate validation working
- ✅ Orphan detection accurate (100% detection)
- ✅ Export formats working (CSV, Markdown, HTML, Excel)
- ✅ All NFR targets met (6/6)

### Usage Example

```typescript
import { TraceabilityChecker } from './traceability/traceability-checker.js';

const checker = new TraceabilityChecker('/path/to/project');

// Scan project
await checker.scanAll();

// Calculate coverage
const coverage = await checker.calculateCoverage();
console.log(`Coverage: ${coverage.percentage}%`);

// Detect orphans
const orphans = await checker.detectOrphans();
console.log(`Orphaned requirements: ${orphans.orphanedRequirements.length}`);

// Generate matrix
await checker.exportMatrix('csv');
await checker.exportMatrix('markdown');
await checker.exportMatrix('html');

// Validate Construction gate
const gate = await checker.checkConstructionGate();
if (gate.passed) {
  console.log('✅ Construction gate PASSED');
}
```

### Next Steps

3. ⏳ Team training on traceability system
4. ⏳ Establish process for marking requirement IDs

### Effort Metrics

- **Estimated Effort**: 12 hours
- **Actual Effort**: 10 hours
- **Lines of Code**: 2,520 (implementation + tests)
