## Calibration Features

### Core Calibration

```typescript
// Calibrate single voice
const result = await calibration.calibrateVoice({
  voice: 'academic',
  targetCharacteristics: {
    formality: 0.85,
    assertiveness: 0.65,
  },
  trainingCorpus: academicTexts,
  validationCorpus: validationTexts,
});

// Results include:
// - beforeAccuracy: 0.72
// - afterAccuracy: 0.91
// - improvement: +0.19 (+26%)
// - validationResults: { precision, recall, f1Score }
```

### Marker Optimization

```typescript
// Optimize markers for a voice using corpus
const markers = await calibration.optimizeMarkers('technical', corpus);

// Process:
// 1. Analyze corpus for marker effectiveness
// 2. Update marker weights (0-1 scale)
// 3. Remove weak markers (weight < 0.1)
// 4. Sort by weight descending
```

### Transformation Accuracy

```typescript
// Test transformation from one voice to another
const result = await calibration.testTransformationAccuracy(
  'academic',
  'technical',
  corpus
);

// Results:
// - accuracy: 0.85 (85% detected as target voice)
// - averageConfidence: 0.78
// - fidelity: 0.82 (how well it matches target characteristics)
```

### Cross-Voice Validation

```typescript
// Generate confusion matrix
const testSet = new Map([
  ['academic', academicCorpus],
  ['technical', technicalCorpus],
  ['executive', executiveCorpus],
  ['casual', casualCorpus],
]);

const matrix = await calibration.validateCrossVoiceDetection(testSet);

// Returns:
// - matrix: actual vs detected voice counts
// - accuracy: overall detection accuracy
// - perVoiceAccuracy: individual voice accuracy
```

## Integration Points

### VoiceAnalyzer Integration
- Uses `analyzeVoice()` for detection accuracy measurement
- Leverages voice characteristics scoring
- Integrates marker detection from analyzer patterns

### ContentDiversifier Integration
- Uses `transformVoice()` for transformation accuracy testing
- Applies voice transformations for fidelity measurement
- Tests all 12 transformation pairs

### WritingValidationEngine Integration
- Voice profiles inform validation rules
- Detection confidence affects validation scores
- Marker weights influence pattern matching

## Known Limitations

1. **Marker Loading Edge Case**: In rare test isolation scenarios, freshly created VoiceCalibration instances may load profiles without markers due to JSON import caching. Workaround implemented with graceful handling.

2. **Vocabulary Level Tuning**: `vocabularyLevel` and `sentenceLength` characteristics cannot be directly tuned via `tuneCharacteristic()` due to their complex types. Use `updateVoiceProfile()` for manual updates.

3. **YAML Import**: YAML profile import is not fully implemented in current version. Only JSON import/export is supported.

## Future Enhancements

1. **Adaptive Learning**: Track calibration results over time and automatically adjust thresholds
2. **Custom Voice Creation Wizard**: Interactive tool for creating new voice profiles
3. **Corpus Generation**: Auto-generate training corpora for specific domains
4. **Real-time Calibration**: Continuous calibration as new content is validated
5. **Multi-language Support**: Extend calibration to non-English voices

## Usage Examples

### Basic Calibration

```typescript
import { VoiceCalibration } from './writing/voice-calibration.js';
import { VoiceAnalyzer } from './writing/voice-analyzer.js';
import { ContentDiversifier } from './writing/content-diversifier.js';

const analyzer = new VoiceAnalyzer();
const diversifier = new ContentDiversifier();
const calibration = new VoiceCalibration(analyzer, diversifier);

// Calibrate academic voice
const academicCorpus = [
  'The research methodology demonstrates empirical validity...',
  'Furthermore, our analysis suggests theoretical foundation...',
  // ... more academic texts
];

const result = await calibration.calibrateVoice({
  voice: 'academic',
  trainingCorpus: academicCorpus,
});

console.log(`Accuracy improved by ${(result.improvement * 100).toFixed(1)}%`);
```

### Profile Customization

```typescript
// Create custom voice profile
const customProfile = calibration.createCustomVoiceProfile(
  'legal',
  {
    formality: 0.90,
    technicality: 0.70,
    assertiveness: 0.75,
    complexity: 0.85,
    sentenceLength: { avg: 28, min: 20, max: 40, variance: 10 },
    vocabularyLevel: 'expert',
    firstPersonUsage: 5,
    passiveVoiceRatio: 35,
  },
  [
    {
      type: 'vocabulary',
      indicator: 'pursuant to',
      weight: 0.90,
      examples: ['pursuant to Section 10', 'pursuant to the agreement'],
    },
    {
      type: 'vocabulary',
      indicator: 'hereinafter',
      weight: 0.85,
      examples: ['hereinafter referred to as', 'hereinafter called'],
    },
  ]
);
```

### Reporting

```typescript
// Generate comprehensive calibration report
const report = calibration.generateCalibrationReport('technical');

console.log(`Voice: ${report.voice}`);
console.log(`Total Markers: ${report.markers.total}`);
console.log(`Average Weight: ${report.markers.averageWeight.toFixed(2)}`);
console.log(`Detection Accuracy: ${(report.accuracy.accuracy * 100).toFixed(1)}%`);
console.log(`Recent Calibrations: ${report.recentCalibrations.length}`);

// Compare two voices
const comparison = calibration.compareVoiceProfiles('academic', 'casual');
console.log(`Similarity: ${(comparison.similarity * 100).toFixed(1)}%`);
console.log(`Biggest Difference: ${comparison.differences[0].characteristic}`);
```
