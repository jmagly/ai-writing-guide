## Implementation Details

### Technical Approach
1. **NFR Content Generation**: Created 7 temporary files with formatted NFR content
   - `/tmp/nfr-perf-additions.md` (12 Performance NFRs)
   - `/tmp/nfr-accuracy-additions.md` (6 Accuracy NFRs)
   - `/tmp/nfr-completeness-additions.md` (3 Completeness NFRs)
   - `/tmp/nfr-security-additions.md` (11 Security NFRs)
   - `/tmp/nfr-reliability-additions.md` (3 Reliability NFRs)
   - `/tmp/nfr-usability-additions.md` (7 Usability NFRs)
   - `/tmp/nfr-freshness-additions.md` (1 Freshness NFR)

2. **Section Insertion**: Used `sed` to insert NFRs before section boundaries
   - Section 2: Inserted after line 472 (before Section 3)
   - Section 4: Inserted after line 1197 (before Section 5)
   - Section 6: Inserted after line 1704 (before Section 7)
   - Section 7: Inserted after line 1942 (before Section 8)
   - Section 8: Inserted after line 2473 (before Section 9)
   - Section 9: Inserted after line 2804 (before Section 10)
   - Section 11: Inserted after line 3187 (before Section 12)

3. **Section 15 Updates**: Replaced subsections with updated P0/P1/P2 lists
   - Section 15.1 table: Updated totals (sed script)
   - Section 15.2 (P0 NFRs): Replaced with 30 NFRs
   - Section 15.3 (P1 NFRs): Replaced with 30 NFRs
   - Section 15.4 (P2 NFRs): Replaced with 22 NFRs
   - Section 15.5 (Strategic Rationale): Updated narrative

### File Modifications
- **Backup Created**: `/tmp/supp-spec-backup.md`
- **Final Output**: `/home/manitcor/dev/ai-writing-guide/.aiwg/requirements/supplemental-specification.md`
- **Line Count**: 2,271 lines (v1.1) → 3,782 lines (v1.2) = +1,511 lines
- **NFR Count**: 48 NFRs (v1.1) → 82 NFRs (v1.2) = +34 NFRs (+71% growth)

## Next Steps

1. **Documentation Synthesizer Review**:
   - Validate NFR format consistency
   - Check traceability completeness
   - Review measurement criteria clarity

2. **Multi-Agent Review**:
   - **Requirements Reviewer**: Validate clarity, testability, traceability
   - **Product Strategist**: Validate P0/P1/P2 prioritization aligns with business value
   - **Architecture Designer**: Validate technical feasibility
   - **Test Architect**: Validate testing approach and coverage
   - **Security Architect**: Validate security NFRs (UC-011)

3. **Baseline v1.2**:
   - After multi-agent review, merge feedback
   - Baseline final version to `.aiwg/requirements/supplemental-specification.md`
   - Update traceability matrix (Section 16) with new NFR-to-UC mappings
