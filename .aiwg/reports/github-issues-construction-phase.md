## Next Steps

### Immediate (Construction Week 1)

1. **Create Additional P0 Feature Issues**:

   - F-007: Test Artifact Generation (UC-009)
   - F-008: Plugin Rollback (UC-010)
   - F-009: Security Validation (UC-011)

2. **Break Down Features into Tech Tasks**:
   - Each feature should have 5-10 tech tasks
   - Estimated total: 50-80 tech tasks for P0 features
   - Link all tasks to parent feature and epic

3. **Create User Story Issues**:
   - User-centric tasks for UX/usability NFRs
   - Integrate with feature development

4. **P1/P2 Feature Issues** (v1.1 and Future):
   - F-010: Metrics Collection (UC-007) - P1
   - F-011: Framework Self-Improvement (UC-005) - P1
   - F-012: Plugin Status Command (FID-008) - P2

### Sprint Planning

**Suggested Sprint Structure** (2-week sprints):

**Sprint 1**: Foundation (Epics #1, #2, #7)
- F-001: AI Pattern Detection
- F-002: Fast Agent Deployment
- T-010: PerformanceProfiler

**Sprint 2**: Analysis & Orchestration (Epics #3, #4)

## Summary

✅ **Created comprehensive GitHub issue hierarchy** for Construction phase:
- 7 Epics mapped to SAD architecture
- 5 P0 Features mapped to Use Cases
- 4 Tech Tasks with detailed implementation guidance
- All issues linked to UC/NFR/SAD/Master Test Plan documents
- Comprehensive labels for filtering and organization

✅ **Label strategy** enables:
- Type-based filtering (epic/feature/tech-task)
- Priority-based planning (P0/P1/P2)
- Component-based assignment (writing/sdlc/plugin/cli/testing)
- Phase-based tracking (construction/elaboration-complete)

✅ **Requirements coverage**:
- 5 of 11 use cases covered in initial tickets
- 15 of 82 NFRs explicitly linked
- 100% traceability to architecture (SAD)
- Clear path to complete P0 MVP scope

**Next Step**: Create additional P0 feature issues (F-006 through F-009) and break down all features into detailed tech tasks (estimated 50-80 tasks total).
