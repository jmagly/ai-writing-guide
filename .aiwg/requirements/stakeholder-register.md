# Stakeholder Register

**Document Type**: Requirements Artifact
**Created**: 2025-10-17
**Author**: Business Process Analyst
**Status**: DRAFT
**Project**: AI Writing Guide (AIWG)
**Version**: 1.0

## Document Purpose

This stakeholder register identifies all parties with interest or influence in the AIWG project, with particular focus on stakeholders critical to proving self-application through the contributor workflow demonstration. Each stakeholder entry includes engagement strategy, communication needs, and success criteria.

## Executive Summary

**Total Stakeholders**: 15 across 4 categories (Internal, External Contributors, Platform/Ecosystem, Enterprise/Commercial)

**Critical Stakeholders for Contributor Workflow**:
1. **Joseph Magly (Maintainer)** - High interest/High influence - Success depends on workflow scalability
2. **Early Contributor Testers (2-5)** - High interest/Medium influence - Validation gatekeepers
3. **Platform Vendors (Claude, OpenAI)** - Medium interest/High influence - Integration enablers
4. **AIWG Users (Current/Prospective)** - High interest/Low influence - Credibility validators

**Key Risk**: Solo maintainer burnout if contributor workflow doesn't reduce support burden by 50%

**Key Opportunity**: Successful self-application demonstration creates reference implementation that drives broader adoption

## Stakeholder Categories

AIWG is launching a contributor workflow to make platform integrations (Cursor, Windsurf, Zed) easy to contribute. I'm looking for 2-5 testers to validate the workflow before broader launch.

**What I need:**
- 30 minutes to try creating a platform integration PR using AIWG tooling
- Feedback survey (5-10 min)
- Optional: 15 min follow-up interview

**What you get:**
- Early access to contributor workflow
- Recognition in CONTRIBUTORS.md and case study
- Direct influence on workflow design

Interested? Reply and I'll send quickstart guide.

Thanks,
Joseph
