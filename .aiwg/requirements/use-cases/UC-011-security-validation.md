## 1. Use-Case Identifier and Name

**ID:** UC-011
**Name:** Security Validation via `/project:security-gate`

## 2. Scope and Level

**Scope:** AIWG Framework Security Validation System
**Level:** User Goal
**System Boundary:** AIWG framework repository, security validators (SAST, dependency scanner, secret scanner), threat model validator, file system (codebase, dependencies, threat models), security report generators

## 3. Primary Actor(s)

**Primary Actors:**
- **Security Gatekeeper agent**: Automated agent enforcing minimum security criteria before release
- **Developer**: Individual running security checks before iteration close or deployment
- **Security Architect**: Security team lead validating threat mitigations and security posture
- **Compliance Officer**: Manager ensuring regulatory compliance (SOC2, ISO, HIPAA, PCI-DSS)
- **QA Lead**: Quality assurance engineer validating security test coverage before release gates

**Actor Goals:**
- Prevent vulnerabilities from reaching production (shift-left security)
- Validate threat model completeness (all assets protected, all threats mitigated)
- Detect hardcoded secrets (API keys, passwords, tokens) before code commit
- Scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities (CVE database validation)
- Ensure <10-second validation time for developer productivity (rapid feedback)
- Generate compliance-ready security reports for audits (SOC2, ISO, HIPAA)

## 4. Stakeholders and Interests

| Stakeholder | Interest |
|------------|----------|
| Enterprise Compliance Officer | SOC2/ISO/HIPAA/PCI-DSS compliance - security validation audit trail required |
| Security Architect | Threat model validation completeness (zero unmitigated P0 threats) |
| Developer | Rapid security feedback (<10s) to avoid context-switching |
| Product Manager | Zero P0 vulnerabilities in production (reputation risk) |
| Auditor (External) | Security validation report for third-party compliance verification |
| CI/CD Pipeline | Automated pre-merge gate (block merges with P0 vulnerabilities) |

## 5. Preconditions

1. AIWG project with `.aiwg/` directory structure
2. Threat model exists (`.aiwg/security/threat-model.md`) OR project in Inception/Elaboration phase (threat model optional)
3. Security requirements defined (NFRs in `.aiwg/requirements/nfrs/NFR-SEC-*.md`)
4. Codebase with implementation files (`.mjs`, `.js`, `.py`, `.md` in `tools/`, `src/`, `.claude/commands/`)
5. Dependencies manifest (package.json, requirements.txt, or equivalent)
6. `.aiwg/security/` directory exists (or will be created)
7. Core Orchestrator (Claude Code) has read access to project files
8. Security tools available (ESLint for JS, Bandit for Python, npm audit, pip-audit, detect-secrets)

## 6. Postconditions

**Success Postconditions:**
- Security gate PASSED
- Security report generated: `.aiwg/security/security-gate-report-YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- Zero P0 vulnerabilities detected (Critical/High severity)
- Zero secrets detected in codebase (API keys, passwords, tokens)
- All dependencies up-to-date (no Critical/High CVEs)
- Threat model validation PASSED (if threat model exists)
- Security NFRs validated (e.g., NFR-SEC-001: Content Privacy - 0 network requests)
- Validation completes in <10 seconds (95th percentile for typical project)
- Security metrics tracked: `.aiwg/metrics/security-history.csv`

**Failure Postconditions:**
- Security gate FAILED (deployment blocked)
- Vulnerabilities listed by severity (P0: Critical/High, P1: Medium, P2: Low)
- Remediation recommendations generated (priority-ordered action items)
- Error log generated: `.aiwg/security/validation-errors.log`
- User notified of failure reason (e.g., "3 Critical vulnerabilities detected: SQL injection, XSS, hardcoded API key")
- Deployment blocked until vulnerabilities resolved (manual override requires Security Architect approval)

## 7. Trigger

**Manual Triggers:**
- Developer invokes: `/project:security-gate` (validate current codebase)
- Developer invokes: `/project:security-gate --update-only` (refresh security report without blocking)
- Developer invokes: `/project:security-gate --accept-risk "UC-010 CSRF acceptable risk per ADR-007"` (override gate with justification)

**Automatic Triggers:**
- CI/CD pipeline pre-merge gate: `npm run security-gate` (GitHub Actions workflow)
- Phase gate validation: Inception → Elaboration, Construction → Transition gates require security PASS
- Scheduled weekly scan: Cron job runs security gate every Monday 8am (detect new CVEs)

**Event Triggers:**
- Dependencies updated (package.json, requirements.txt modified)
- Threat model updated (new assets or threats added)
- Security NFRs updated (new security requirements added)

## 8. Main Success Scenario

1. **Developer initiates security gate**
   - Developer invokes: `/project:security-gate`
   - Core Orchestrator (Claude Code) receives command
   - Orchestrator validates arguments:
     - Project directory: `.` (current working directory)
     - Options: `--update-only` (refresh report only), `--accept-risk "justification"` (override gate)
   - Orchestrator displays: "Security gate validation starting..."

2. **System initializes security workspace**
   - System checks if `.aiwg/security/` directory exists
   - If missing, creates directory: `mkdir -p .aiwg/security`
   - System creates temporary workspace: `.aiwg/working/security-gate-YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS/`
   - System loads security configuration: `.aiwg/config/security-config.yaml` (if exists)
     - Secret patterns: API key regex, AWS key regex, password regex, token regex
     - SAST tool paths: ESLint path, Bandit path
     - Dependency scanner paths: npm audit, pip-audit, safety
     - CVE database API: NIST NVD, GitHub Advisory
   - System logs initialization: "Security workspace initialized: .aiwg/working/security-gate-2025-10-22-153045/"

3. **System loads security requirements**
   - System scans `.aiwg/requirements/nfrs/` directory for security NFRs
   - System identifies security requirements:
     - NFR-SEC-001: Content Privacy (0 network requests)
     - NFR-SEC-002: File Permissions (no sudo access required)
     - NFR-SEC-003: Attack Detection (100% known vectors blocked)
     - NFR-SEC-004: Dependency Integrity (SHA-256 verification)
     - NFR-SEC-005: Secret Protection (0% secrets in codebase)
   - System loads threat model (if exists): `.aiwg/security/threat-model.md`
     - Extracts assets: User data, configuration files, API keys, source code
     - Extracts threats: SQL injection, XSS, CSRF, path traversal, RCE
     - Extracts mitigations: Input validation, output encoding, CSRF tokens, path sanitization
   - System logs security baseline: "Loaded 5 security NFRs, 4 assets, 5 threats, 5 mitigations"

4. **System scans codebase for secrets (detect-secrets)**
   - System determines codebase directories:
     - Primary: `tools/`, `src/`, `lib/`, `.claude/commands/`, `agentic/`
     - Exclusions: `node_modules/`, `.git/`, `tests/`, `.aiwg/`, `dist/`, `build/`
   - System runs secret scanner: `detect-secrets scan --all-files`
   - System searches for secret patterns:
     - **API keys**: `/[A-Za-z0-9]{20,}/` (generic 20+ char strings)
     - **AWS keys**: `/AKIA[0-9A-Z]{16}/` (AWS access key format)
     - **Passwords**: `/password\s*=\s*["'][^"']{8,}/` (password assignments)
     - **Tokens**: `/token\s*=\s*["'][A-Za-z0-9_-]{20,}/` (JWT, OAuth tokens)
     - **Private keys**: `/-----BEGIN (RSA|DSA|EC|OPENSSH) PRIVATE KEY-----/`
   - System validates detected secrets:
     - Check if secret is in `.aiwg/security/secret-whitelist.txt` (test fixtures, examples)
     - Check if secret is entropy-filtered (low entropy = likely false positive)
   - System logs secret scan results:
     - "Secret scan complete: 0 secrets detected (3 false positives filtered)"
     - OR "Secret scan FAILED: 2 secrets detected (API key in config.js, password in setup.py)"
   - System records findings:
     - Secrets detected: 0 (PASS) or 2 (FAIL)
     - File paths: `tools/config.js:42`, `tools/setup.py:18`
     - Secret types: API key, password

5. **System runs SAST (Static Application Security Testing)**
   - System determines SAST tool based on language:
     - **JavaScript/TypeScript**: ESLint with security plugins (`eslint-plugin-security`, `eslint-plugin-no-unsanitized`)
     - **Python**: Bandit (security-focused linter)
     - **Markdown**: No SAST (skip for command files)
   - System runs SAST for JavaScript files:
     - Command: `eslint --config .eslintrc.security.json tools/ src/ lib/ --format json`
     - Detects vulnerabilities:
       - SQL injection: `db.query("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id=" + userId)` (Severity: Critical)
       - XSS: `innerHTML = userInput` (Severity: High)
       - Eval usage: `eval(userCode)` (Severity: Critical)
       - Weak crypto: `crypto.createHash('md5')` (Severity: Medium)
   - System runs SAST for Python files:
     - Command: `bandit -r tools/ src/ -f json`
     - Detects vulnerabilities:
       - SQL injection: `cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id=" + user_id)` (Severity: Critical)
       - Path traversal: `open(user_path, 'r')` (Severity: High)
       - Shell injection: `os.system(user_command)` (Severity: Critical)
   - System filters false positives:
     - Apply whitelist: `.aiwg/security/sast-whitelist.txt` (known safe patterns)
     - Apply entropy filtering: Low-entropy strings likely false positives
     - Apply context analysis: Test files excluded from Critical/High (acceptable for test mocks)
   - System logs SAST results:
     - "SAST complete: 12 findings (3 Critical, 4 High, 5 Medium)"
     - OR "SAST complete: 0 findings (all files clean)"
   - System records findings:
     - Critical vulnerabilities: 3 (SQL injection, eval usage, shell injection)
     - High vulnerabilities: 4 (XSS, path traversal, insecure deserialization, weak crypto)
     - Medium vulnerabilities: 5 (missing CSRF tokens, weak password hashing, info disclosure)

6. **System scans dependencies for CVEs (npm audit, pip-audit)**
   - System determines dependency files:
     - **JavaScript**: `package.json` → run `npm audit --json`
     - **Python**: `requirements.txt` → run `pip-audit --format json`
   - System runs dependency scanner (npm audit):
     - Command: `npm audit --json`
     - Queries CVE database: NIST NVD, GitHub Advisory
     - Detects vulnerable dependencies:
       - `lodash@4.17.15`: CVE-2020-8203 (Prototype Pollution, Severity: High)
       - `axios@0.19.0`: CVE-2020-28168 (SSRF, Severity: Medium)

     - `lodash@4.17.15` → `lodash@4.17.21` (patch available)
     - `minimist@1.2.0` → `minimist@1.2.6` (patch available)
   - System logs dependency scan results:
     - "Dependency scan complete: 5 CVEs detected (1 Critical, 2 High, 2 Medium)"
     - OR "Dependency scan complete: 0 CVEs detected (all dependencies up-to-date)"
   - System records findings:
     - Critical CVEs: 1 (minimist prototype pollution)
     - High CVEs: 2 (lodash prototype pollution, django path traversal)
     - Medium CVEs: 2 (axios SSRF, requests header injection)
     - Upgrade paths: `lodash@4.17.21`, `minimist@1.2.6`, `django@3.2.0`, `requests@2.31.0`

7. **System validates threat model completeness (if threat model exists)**
   - System checks if threat model exists: `.aiwg/security/threat-model.md`
   - If threat model missing:
     - Skip threat model validation (acceptable for Inception/Elaboration phase)
     - Display warning: "Threat model missing - recommend creating before production deployment"
   - If threat model exists:
     - System parses threat model structure:
       - Assets: User data, configuration files, API keys, source code
       - Threats: SQL injection, XSS, CSRF, path traversal, RCE
       - Mitigations: Input validation, output encoding, CSRF tokens, path sanitization, sandboxing
     - System validates completeness:
       - **All assets have threats defined**: 4/4 assets (100%)
       - **All threats have risk ratings**: 5/5 threats have Impact × Likelihood ratings
       - **All P0 threats (High risk) have mitigations**: 3/3 P0 threats mitigated
     - System validates mitigations implemented:
       - Cross-reference mitigations with codebase (search for mitigation keywords)
       - Example: "Input validation" mitigation → search for `sanitize()`, `validate()` functions
       - Example: "CSRF tokens" mitigation → search for CSRF middleware in framework config
     - System logs threat model validation:
       - "Threat model validation PASSED: 100% asset coverage, 100% P0 threat mitigations"
       - OR "Threat model validation FAILED: 2 P0 threats lack mitigations (XSS, CSRF)"
   - System records findings:
     - Threat model completeness: 100% (PASS) or <100% (FAIL)
     - Unmitigated P0 threats: 0 (PASS) or 2 (FAIL)

8. **System validates security NFRs**
   - For each security NFR:
     - **NFR-SEC-001: Content Privacy (0 network requests)**:
       - Search codebase for network calls: `fetch()`, `axios()`, `XMLHttpRequest`, `requests.get()`
       - Validate: 0 network requests detected (PASS) or N requests detected (FAIL)
     - **NFR-SEC-002: File Permissions (no sudo access)**:
       - Search codebase for privilege escalation: `sudo`, `su`, `setuid`, `os.setuid()`
       - Validate: 0 privilege escalation calls (PASS) or N calls detected (FAIL)
     - **NFR-SEC-003: Attack Detection (100% known vectors blocked)**:

     - **NFR-SEC-004: Dependency Integrity (SHA-256 verification)**:
       - Check if `package-lock.json` or `requirements.txt.lock` exists (lockfile with SHA-256 hashes)
       - Validate: Lockfile exists with SHA-256 hashes (PASS) or missing lockfile (FAIL)
     - **NFR-SEC-005: Secret Protection (0% secrets in codebase)**:
       - Cross-reference secret scan findings (from Step 4)
       - Validate: 0 secrets detected (PASS) or N secrets detected (FAIL)
   - System logs NFR validation results:
     - "NFR validation complete: 5/5 NFRs PASSED"
     - OR "NFR validation FAILED: 2/5 NFRs FAILED (NFR-SEC-001: 3 network requests, NFR-SEC-005: 2 secrets)"
   - System records findings:
     - NFRs passed: 5/5 (PASS) or 3/5 (FAIL)
     - NFRs failed: 0 (PASS) or 2 (FAIL)

9. **System aggregates security findings**

        - To: `db.query("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id=?", [userId])`
      - **Priority 2**: Remove hardcoded API key in `tools/config.js:42`
        - Change: `const apiKey = "AKIA1234567890ABCDEF"`
        - To: `const apiKey = process.env.API_KEY`
        - Add to `.env`: `API_KEY=AKIA1234567890ABCDEF`
        - Add to `.gitignore`: `.env`
      - **Priority 3**: Upgrade vulnerable dependencies
        - Run: `npm update lodash minimist`
        - Verify: `package.json` now shows `lodash@4.17.21`, `minimist@1.2.6`
    - Developer re-runs security gate: `/project:security-gate`
    - System validates fixes:
      - Secrets: 0 detected (API key moved to `.env`)

## 9. Alternate Flows

### Alt-1: Threat Model Missing (Early-Stage Project)

**Branch Point:** Step 7 (System validates threat model completeness)
**Condition:** Threat model file missing (`.aiwg/security/threat-model.md` not found)

**Flow:**
1. System attempts to read threat model: `.aiwg/security/threat-model.md`
2. File not found error (project in Inception/Elaboration phase)
3. System detects missing threat model
4. System displays warning:
   ```
   ⚠️ Threat model missing

   Threat model file: .aiwg/security/threat-model.md
   Status: NOT FOUND

   Impact: Partial security validation (secrets, SAST, dependencies only)
   Recommendation: Create threat model before production deployment

   Threat model validation SKIPPED (acceptable for early-stage projects)
   ```
5. System skips threat model validation (Step 7)
6. System continues with NFR validation (Step 8)
7. System includes warning in security report:
   - "Threat model missing - recommend creating before production deployment"
   - Threat model completeness: N/A (skipped)
8. **Resume Main Flow:** Step 8 (System validates security NFRs)

**Alternate Outcome:**
- Security gate can still PASS (if secrets, SAST, dependencies, NFRs clean)
- Threat model warning included in report (informational)
- No deployment block (threat model optional for pre-production phases)

### Alt-2: Acceptable Risk Approval (Security Architect Override)

**Branch Point:** Step 10 (System evaluates security gate criteria)
**Condition:** P0 vulnerabilities exist, but Security Architect approves acceptable risk

**Flow:**
1. System detects P0 vulnerabilities: 1 CSRF vulnerability (High severity)
2. System evaluates gate: FAIL (P0 threshold: 0)
3. Developer invokes gate with acceptable risk override:
   - Command: `/project:security-gate --accept-risk "CSRF acceptable risk for internal tool per ADR-007"`
4. System prompts Security Architect for approval:
   ```
   ⚠️ Acceptable Risk Override Requested

   Developer: john.doe@example.com
   Justification: "CSRF acceptable risk for internal tool per ADR-007"
   P0 Vulnerabilities: 1 (CSRF vulnerability in tools/api.js:120)

   Security Architect approval required.
   Approve acceptable risk? (y/n)
   ```
5. Security Architect reviews justification:
   - Reads ADR-007: "CSRF protection not required for internal tools (no external users)"
   - Confirms tool is internal-only (no public-facing API)
6. Security Architect approves: "y"
7. System logs approval decision:
   - File: `.aiwg/security/acceptable-risks.log`
   - Entry: `2025-10-22 15:30:45 | APPROVED | CSRF vulnerability (tools/api.js:120) | Justification: Internal tool per ADR-007 | Approved by: alice.smith@example.com`
8. System overrides gate decision:
   - **Gate Decision**: PASS (with acceptable risk warning)
9. System includes override notice in security report:
   - "Security gate PASSED with acceptable risk approval"
   - "1 P0 vulnerability approved by Security Architect: CSRF (tools/api.js:120)"
   - "Justification: CSRF acceptable risk for internal tool per ADR-007"
   - "Approved by: alice.smith@example.com on 2025-10-22 15:30:45"
10. **Resume Main Flow:** Step 11 (System generates security report)

**Alternate Outcome:**
- Security gate PASSES despite P0 vulnerability (override approved)
- Acceptable risk logged in `.aiwg/security/acceptable-risks.log`
- Override notice included in security report (audit trail)

### Alt-3: New CVE Published (Stale Dependency)

**Branch Point:** Step 6 (System scans dependencies for CVEs)
**Condition:** New CVE published since last scan (dependency now vulnerable)

**Flow:**
1. System runs dependency scanner: `npm audit --json`
2. CVE database query detects new vulnerability:
   - `express@4.17.1`: CVE-2022-24999 (published 2025-10-20, 2 days ago)
   - Severity: High (Denial of Service)
3. System detects CVE published after last security gate (staleness):
   - Last security gate: 2025-10-15 (7 days ago)
   - New CVE published: 2025-10-20 (2 days ago)
4. System flags stale dependency:
   ```
   ⚠️ New CVE detected (published since last scan)

   Dependency: express@4.17.1
   CVE: CVE-2022-24999
   Severity: High (Denial of Service)
   Published: 2025-10-20 (2 days ago)
   Last Scan: 2025-10-15 (7 days ago)

   Impact: Dependency now vulnerable (was clean in last scan)
   Upgrade Path: express@4.18.2 (patch available)
   ```
5. System adds CVE to findings:
   - High CVEs: +1 (express DoS vulnerability)
6. System logs new CVE detection:
   - "New CVE detected: CVE-2022-24999 (express@4.17.1) - published 2 days ago"
7. System includes staleness warning in security report:
   - "1 new CVE detected since last scan (2025-10-15)"
   - "Recommendation: Run security gate weekly to detect new CVEs"
8. **Resume Main Flow:** Step 9 (System aggregates security findings)

**Alternate Outcome:**
- Security gate FAILS (new High CVE triggers P0 threshold)
- New CVE flagged in security report (staleness notice)
- Recommendation: Weekly security scans to detect new CVEs early

### Alt-4: False Positive Rate High (SAST Noise)

**Branch Point:** Step 5 (System runs SAST)
**Condition:** SAST tool reports >50 findings (likely false positives)

**Flow:**
1. System runs ESLint with security plugins
2. SAST tool reports 127 findings:
   - 3 Critical, 8 High, 45 Medium, 71 Low
3. System detects high false positive rate:
   - Finding count: 127 (exceeds 50-finding threshold)
   - Likely cause: Overly strict security rules, test file inclusion
4. System applies false positive filtering:
   - **Whitelist filtering**: Apply `.aiwg/security/sast-whitelist.txt`
     - Entry: `tools/test-mocks.js:*` (exclude all findings from test mocks)
     - Entry: `lib/experimental/*` (exclude experimental code)
   - **Context analysis**: Exclude test files from Critical/High findings
     - Test files: `*.test.js`, `*.spec.js`, `tests/`, `__tests__/`
     - Rationale: Test mocks intentionally use unsafe patterns (acceptable for testing)
   - **Entropy filtering**: Exclude low-entropy findings (likely false positives)
     - Example: "Potential XSS in console.log(userInput)" (false positive - console.log not XSS vector)
5. System re-evaluates findings after filtering:
   - Original: 127 findings (3 Critical, 8 High, 45 Medium, 71 Low)
   - Filtered: 18 findings (3 Critical, 4 High, 5 Medium, 6 Low)
   - False positives filtered: 109 (86% false positive rate)
6. System logs filtering statistics:
   - "SAST false positive filtering: 127 findings → 18 findings (109 false positives filtered, 86% FP rate)"
7. System displays filtering summary:
   ```
   ⚠️ High false positive rate detected

   Original SAST findings: 127
   Filtered findings: 18
   False positives removed: 109 (86%)

   Filtering applied:
   - Whitelist: 45 findings excluded (test mocks, experimental code)
   - Context analysis: 38 findings excluded (test files)
   - Entropy filtering: 26 findings excluded (low-entropy false positives)

   Recommendation: Review `.aiwg/security/sast-whitelist.txt` for accuracy
   ```
8. **Resume Main Flow:** Step 6 (System scans dependencies for CVEs)

**Alternate Outcome:**
- SAST findings reduced from 127 to 18 (86% false positive rate)
- Filtering statistics logged in security report
- Recommendation: Review whitelist for accuracy (avoid over-filtering)

## 10. Exception Flows

### Exc-1: SAST Tool Missing (ESLint/Bandit Not Installed)

**Trigger:** Step 5 (System runs SAST)
**Condition:** ESLint or Bandit library not installed

**Flow:**
1. System attempts to run ESLint: `eslint --config .eslintrc.security.json tools/ --format json`
2. Command error: `eslint: command not found` (ESLint not installed)
3. System catches SAST tool error
4. System displays error message:
   ```
   ❌ SAST tool missing

   Tool: ESLint (JavaScript SAST)
   Status: NOT INSTALLED

   Impact: JavaScript security analysis unavailable (partial security validation)

   Remediation Steps:
   1. Install ESLint: `npm install --save-dev eslint eslint-plugin-security eslint-plugin-no-unsanitized`
   2. Create ESLint security config: `.eslintrc.security.json`
   3. Re-run `/project:security-gate` after installation

   SAST validation SKIPPED for JavaScript files (continuing with Python SAST)
   ```
5. System logs SAST tool error: `.aiwg/security/validation-errors.log`
   - Entry: `2025-10-22 15:30:00 | ERROR | SAST tool missing: ESLint | Skipping JavaScript SAST`
6. System skips JavaScript SAST (graceful degradation)
7. System continues with Python SAST (Bandit)
8. System includes SAST tool warning in security report:
   - "SAST validation incomplete: ESLint missing (JavaScript files not scanned)"
   - "Recommendation: Install ESLint for complete security validation"
9. **Resume Main Flow:** Step 6 (System scans dependencies for CVEs)

**Expected Result:** Partial security validation (Python SAST only), ESLint installation recommended

### Exc-2: Secret Scanner Timeout (Large Codebase)

**Trigger:** Step 4 (System scans codebase for secrets)
**Condition:** Secret scan exceeds 60-second timeout (very large codebase >10,000 files)

**Flow:**
1. System runs secret scanner: `detect-secrets scan --all-files`
2. Secret scan processes 8,000 files in 50 seconds
3. Secret scan continues to process remaining 3,000 files
4. Secret scan exceeds 60-second timeout (codebase too large)
5. System detects timeout at 65 seconds
6. System cancels secret scan (graceful timeout)
7. System logs timeout: `.aiwg/security/validation-errors.log`
   - Entry: `2025-10-22 15:30:00 | ERROR | Secret scan timeout (65 seconds > 60s threshold) | 8,000/11,000 files scanned (73% complete)`
8. System prompts user:
   ```
   ⚠️ Secret scan timeout

   Elapsed time: 65 seconds (threshold: 60 seconds)
   Files scanned: 8,000 / 11,000 (73% complete)

   Options:
   1. Continue with partial scan results (8,000 files)
   2. Extend timeout to 120 seconds (scan all 11,000 files)
   3. Enable incremental scanning (cache scanned files for next run)
   ```
9. User selects: "3 - Enable incremental scanning"
10. System enables incremental scanning:
    - Cache scanned files: Save scanned file hashes to `.aiwg/security/cache/secret-scan-cache.json`
    - Next run: Load cache, only scan new/modified files (delta scanning)
11. System completes scan in incremental mode:
    - Cached files: 8,000 (from current run)
    - Delta files: 3,000 (new/modified since cache)
    - Total scan time: 80 seconds (exceeds 60s threshold, but acceptable for one-time setup)
12. System logs incremental scanning: "Incremental secret scanning enabled - cached 8,000 files for next run (next run: <15s)"
13. **Resume Main Flow:** Step 5 (System runs SAST)

**Expected Result:** Incremental scanning enabled for large codebases, future scans meet <10s threshold

### Exc-3: CVE Database Unavailable (Network Error)

**Trigger:** Step 6 (System scans dependencies for CVEs)
**Condition:** CVE database API returns 503 (service unavailable) or network timeout

**Flow:**
1. System runs dependency scanner: `npm audit --json`
2. CVE database query: `https://registry.npmjs.org/-/npm/v1/security/audits`
3. Network error: `503 Service Unavailable` (NIST NVD API down)
4. System catches CVE database error
5. System displays error message:
   ```
   ⚠️ CVE database unavailable

   CVE Database: NIST NVD / npm Registry
   Error: 503 Service Unavailable (API down)

   Impact: Dependency vulnerability scan unavailable (partial security validation)

   Fallback: Using cached CVE database (if available)
   Cache age: 3 days old (last update: 2025-10-19)
   ```
6. System falls back to cached CVE database:
   - Check if cache exists: `.aiwg/security/cache/cve-cache.json`
   - If cache exists: Load cached CVE data (stale data, but better than no data)
   - If cache missing: Skip dependency scan entirely
7. System runs dependency scan with cached CVE data:
   - Detects vulnerabilities using 3-day-old CVE data
   - Flags cache staleness: "CVE data is 3 days old - may miss recently published CVEs"
8. System logs CVE database error: `.aiwg/security/validation-errors.log`
   - Entry: `2025-10-22 15:30:00 | ERROR | CVE database unavailable (503 Service Unavailable) | Using cached CVE data (3 days old)`
9. System includes cache staleness warning in security report:
   - "CVE database unavailable - using cached data (3 days old)"
   - "Recommendation: Re-run security gate when CVE database available (detect recently published CVEs)"
10. **Resume Main Flow:** Step 7 (System validates threat model completeness)

**Expected Result:** Dependency scan completes with cached CVE data (stale but functional), staleness warning included

### Exc-4: Threat Model Parse Error (Invalid YAML Format)

**Trigger:** Step 7 (System validates threat model completeness)
**Condition:** Threat model file has invalid YAML/Markdown format

**Flow:**
1. System reads threat model file: `.aiwg/security/threat-model.md`
2. System attempts to parse threat model structure (YAML frontmatter or Markdown sections)
3. Parse error detected:
   - YAML syntax error: `Line 12: Invalid indentation (expected 2 spaces, found 4)`
   - OR Markdown structure error: `Section "Assets" missing (expected section headers: Assets, Threats, Mitigations)`
4. System catches parse exception
5. System displays error message:
   ```
   ❌ Threat model parse error

   File: .aiwg/security/threat-model.md
   Error: YAML syntax error (Line 12: Invalid indentation)

   Impact: Threat model validation unavailable (partial security validation)

   Remediation Steps:
   1. Fix YAML syntax error in `.aiwg/security/threat-model.md`
   2. Validate YAML structure: `yamllint .aiwg/security/threat-model.md`
   3. Re-run `/project:security-gate` after fix
   ```
6. System logs parse error: `.aiwg/security/validation-errors.log`
   - Entry: `2025-10-22 15:30:00 | ERROR | Threat model parse error (YAML syntax error Line 12) | Skipping threat model validation`
7. System skips threat model validation (graceful degradation)
8. System includes parse error in security report:
   - "Threat model validation SKIPPED (parse error: YAML syntax error Line 12)"
   - "Recommendation: Fix threat model YAML syntax and re-run security gate"
9. **Resume Main Flow:** Step 8 (System validates security NFRs)

**Expected Result:** Threat model validation skipped, parse error logged, remediation steps provided

### Exc-5: File Permission Error (Read Access Denied)

**Trigger:** Step 4 (System scans codebase for secrets)
**Condition:** System lacks read permissions for codebase directory

**Flow:**
1. System attempts to scan codebase directory: `tools/`
2. Permission denied error (user lacks read permissions)
3. System catches permission exception
4. System displays error message:
   ```
   ❌ File permission error

   Directory: tools/
   Error: Permission denied (read access required)

   Remediation Steps:
   1. Grant read permissions: `chmod +r -R tools/`
   2. Run security gate with elevated permissions: `sudo /project:security-gate`
   3. Verify file ownership: `ls -la tools/`
   ```
5. System logs error: `.aiwg/security/validation-errors.log`
   - Entry: `2025-10-22 15:30:00 | ERROR | Permission denied: tools/ | User lacks read access`
6. System exits with status code: `1` (error - permission required)

**Expected Result:** User grants read permissions or runs with elevated privileges, re-runs security gate

### Exc-6: Security Gate Timeout (Very Large Project)

**Trigger:** Step 4-6 (System scans codebase, runs SAST, scans dependencies)
**Condition:** Total validation time exceeds 10-second timeout for typical project (very large enterprise project)

**Flow:**
1. System starts validation timer at Step 1
2. System processes secret scan (5 seconds), SAST (8 seconds), dependency scan (4 seconds)
3. Total validation time: 17 seconds (exceeds 10s threshold for typical project)
4. System detects timeout at 17 seconds
5. System displays timeout warning:
   ```
   ⚠️ Security validation timeout

   Elapsed time: 17 seconds (threshold: 10 seconds for typical project)
   Validation status: COMPLETE (all scans finished)

   Note: Large project detected (5,000+ files, 500+ dependencies)
   Validation time exceeds typical threshold but acceptable for large projects

   Options:
   1. Accept longer validation time (17 seconds) for large project
   2. Enable incremental validation (cache scans for <10s future runs)
   ```
6. User selects: "2 - Enable incremental validation"
7. System enables incremental validation:
   - Cache secret scan results: `.aiwg/security/cache/secret-scan-cache.json`
   - Cache SAST results: `.aiwg/security/cache/sast-cache.json`
   - Cache dependency scan results: `.aiwg/security/cache/dependency-cache.json`
8. System completes validation (17 seconds - first run)
9. System logs incremental validation: "Incremental validation enabled - cached scans for next run (next run: <10s)"
10. System displays final summary:
    - "Validation complete (17 seconds - first run, incremental mode enabled)"
    - "Next run: <10 seconds (delta validation only)"
11. **Resume Main Flow:** Step 11 (System generates security report)

**Expected Result:** Incremental validation enabled for large projects, future runs meet <10s threshold

## 12. Related Business Rules

**BR-SEC-001: Security Gate Criteria**
- **P0 vulnerabilities (Critical/High)**: Gate FAIL (blocks deployment)
- **P1 vulnerabilities (Medium)**: Gate PASS with warnings (log for remediation within 30 days)
- **P2 vulnerabilities (Low/Info)**: Gate PASS (informational only)
- Rationale: Critical/High vulnerabilities pose immediate risk to production

**BR-SEC-002: Vulnerability Severity Classification**
- **Critical**: Remote Code Execution (RCE), Authentication Bypass, Arbitrary File Write
- **High**: SQL Injection, XSS, CSRF, Path Traversal, SSRF, Insecure Deserialization
- **Medium**: Information Disclosure, Weak Cryptography, Missing Security Headers, CSRF (low-impact endpoints)
- **Low**: Code Quality Issues, Deprecated Functions, Informational Warnings
- Rationale: OWASP Top 10 severity standards

**BR-SEC-003: Secret Detection Patterns**
- **API keys**: `/[A-Za-z0-9]{20,}/` (generic 20+ char strings)
- **AWS keys**: `/AKIA[0-9A-Z]{16}/` (AWS access key format)
- **Passwords**: `/password\s*=\s*["'][^"']{8,}/` (password assignments)
- **Tokens**: `/token\s*=\s*["'][A-Za-z0-9_-]{20,}/` (JWT, OAuth tokens)
- **Private keys**: `/-----BEGIN (RSA|DSA|EC|OPENSSH) PRIVATE KEY-----/`
- Rationale: Industry-standard secret patterns

**BR-SEC-004: Dependency Vulnerability Thresholds**
- **Critical CVE**: Update within 24 hours (immediate remediation)
- **High CVE**: Update within 7 days (weekly sprint)
- **Medium CVE**: Update within 30 days (monthly maintenance)
- **Low CVE**: Update at next major release (backlog item)
- Rationale: Risk-based remediation timeline

**BR-SEC-005: Threat Model Completeness Criteria**
- All assets must have threats defined (100% asset coverage)
- All threats must have risk ratings: Impact (1-5) × Likelihood (1-5)
- All P0 threats (risk rating ≥15) must have mitigations implemented
- Rationale: Risk-based threat prioritization

**BR-SEC-006: Acceptable Risk Approval Process**
- Security Architect approval required for all P0 acceptable risk overrides
- Justification must reference ADR (Architecture Decision Record) or risk acceptance document
- Acceptable risk logged in `.aiwg/security/acceptable-risks.log` (audit trail)
- Acceptable risk reviewed quarterly (risk re-assessment)
- Rationale: Risk governance and accountability

**BR-SEC-007: False Positive Filtering Policy**
- Whitelist: `.aiwg/security/sast-whitelist.txt` (explicitly approved exceptions)
- Context analysis: Test files excluded from Critical/High findings (test mocks acceptable)
- Entropy filtering: Low-entropy findings excluded (likely false positives)
- Manual review required for all whitelist additions (avoid over-filtering)
- Rationale: Balance security with developer productivity

**BR-SEC-008: Incremental Validation Policy**
- Cache enabled automatically for projects >5,000 files
- Cache expiration: 7 days (invalidate stale cache)
- Cache invalidation triggers: Dependencies updated, threat model updated, security NFRs updated
- Rationale: Large project performance optimization

## 13. Data Requirements

### Input Data

| Data Element | Format | Source | Validation |

**Test Steps:**
1. Invoke security gate
2. Verify gate summary displayed to console/Claude Code response
3. Verify summary word count: <500 words
4. Verify summary includes: Gate decision, finding counts (P0/P1/P2), validation results, next actions
5. Verify summary does not include detailed findings (only in report)
**Expected Result:** Summary <500 words, includes key information only
**NFR Validated:** NFR-SEC-USE-02 (Summary Brevity <500 words)
**Pass/Fail:** PASS if summary <500 words

### TC-SEC-017: Security Metrics Update

**Objective:** Validate security metrics update for gate PASS
**Preconditions:** Security gate PASS (0 P0 vulnerabilities)
**Test Steps:**
1. Create clean codebase (0 vulnerabilities)
2. Invoke security gate
3. Verify gate PASS
4. Verify security metrics updated: `.aiwg/metrics/security-history.csv`
5. Verify CSV row: `2025-10-22,PASSED,0,5,2,8s,100%,5/5`
6. Verify columns: Date, Gate Decision, P0 Count, P1 Count, P2 Count, Validation Time, Threat Model %, NFRs Passed
**Expected Result:** Security metrics updated with gate PASS data
**NFR Validated:** NFR-SEC-REL-02 (Error Recovery, 100% Error Logging)
**Pass/Fail:** PASS if metrics updated

### TC-SEC-018: End-to-End Security Validation

**Objective:** Validate complete end-to-end security validation workflow
**Preconditions:** AIWG project with codebase, dependencies, threat model
**Test Steps:**
1. Create project with 1,000 files, 100 dependencies, threat model
2. Introduce 3 P0 vulnerabilities: SQL injection, hardcoded secret, High CVE
3. Invoke: `/project:security-gate`
4. Wait for validation to complete (Steps 1-16)
5. Verify all outputs generated:
   - Security report: `.aiwg/security/security-gate-report-2025-10-22.md` (3,200 words)
   - Validation log: `.aiwg/security/validation.log`
   - Secret scan output: `.aiwg/working/security-gate-*/secrets.json`
   - SAST output: `.aiwg/working/security-gate-*/sast-eslint.json`
   - Dependency scan output: `.aiwg/working/security-gate-*/npm-audit.json`
6. Verify gate FAIL (3 P0 vulnerabilities)
7. Developer remediates P0 vulnerabilities
8. Re-run security gate
9. Verify gate PASS (0 P0 vulnerabilities)
10. Verify security metrics updated
**Expected Result:** Complete end-to-end workflow executes successfully, gate FAIL → remediation → gate PASS
**NFR Validated:** All NFRs (Performance, Accuracy, Completeness, Reliability, Usability)
**Pass/Fail:** PASS if end-to-end workflow completes successfully
