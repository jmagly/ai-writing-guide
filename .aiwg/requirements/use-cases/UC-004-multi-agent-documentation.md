## 7. Trigger

**Manual Triggers:**
- User requests: "Create architecture baseline"
- User requests: "Generate Software Architecture Document with security review"
- User invokes: `/project:flow-inception-to-elaboration` (triggers SAD + ADRs + Test Plan)

**Natural Language Triggers:**
- "Build SAD with performance focus"
- "Create ADR for database selection with 5 reviewers"
- "Generate test plan with security validation"

**Workflow Triggers:**
- Phase transition workflows (Inception → Elaboration triggers architecture baseline)
- Iteration workflows (Iteration N requires artifact generation for feature delivery)

## 8. Main Success Scenario

1. **User initiates multi-agent workflow**
   - User requests: "Create architecture baseline"
   - Core Orchestrator (Claude Code) receives request
   - Orchestrator interprets natural language → maps to `flow-inception-to-elaboration` workflow
   - Orchestrator validates preconditions:
     - Requirements baseline exists (`.aiwg/requirements/` directory contains 11 use cases, 60 NFRs)
     - SDLC agents deployed (`.claude/agents/` contains 58 agents)
     - Working directories writable (`.aiwg/working/` available)

2. **Orchestrator initializes multi-agent workspace**
   - Orchestrator determines artifact type: Software Architecture Document (SAD)
   - Orchestrator creates working directories:
     - Primary draft: `mkdir -p .aiwg/working/architecture/sad/drafts`
     - Reviews: `mkdir -p .aiwg/working/architecture/sad/reviews`
     - Consensus: `mkdir -p .aiwg/working/architecture/sad/consensus`
     - Logs: `mkdir -p .aiwg/working/architecture/sad/logs`
   - Orchestrator loads configuration:
     - Default reviewer panel: Security Architect, Test Architect, Requirements Analyst, Technical Writer
     - Approval threshold: 75% (3/4 reviewers must approve)
     - Parallel execution: 4 reviewers launched simultaneously
   - Orchestrator logs initialization: "Multi-agent workspace initialized for SAD generation (4 reviewers, 75% approval threshold)"

3. **Orchestrator selects Primary Author agent**
   - Orchestrator determines Primary Author based on artifact type:
     - SAD → Architecture Designer
     - ADR → Architecture Designer
     - Test Plan → Test Engineer
     - Security Threat Model → Security Architect
   - Orchestrator validates Primary Author agent available (`.claude/agents/architecture-designer.md` exists)
   - Orchestrator logs selection: "Primary Author: Architecture Designer (specializes in SAD generation)"

4. **Primary Author generates initial draft (v0.1)**
   - Orchestrator launches Architecture Designer via Task tool:
     - Task description: "Generate Software Architecture Document draft (v0.1)"
     - Prompt: "Read requirements from `.aiwg/requirements/`. Read SAD template from `~/.local/share/ai-writing-guide/templates/analysis-design/software-architecture-doc-template.md`. Generate comprehensive SAD covering: 1) System Overview, 2) Architecture Views, 3) Component Design, 4) Quality Attributes, 5) Deployment, 6) Traceability. Save draft to: `.aiwg/working/architecture/sad/drafts/v0.1-primary-draft.md`"
   - Architecture Designer executes:
     - Reads 11 use cases, 60 NFRs from requirements baseline
     - Reads SAD template (8,000-word template with 10 sections)
     - Generates SAD draft (3,245 words) covering:
       - Section 1: System Overview (problem statement, stakeholders, constraints)
       - Section 2: Architecture Views (logical, physical, deployment, data)
       - Section 3: Component Design (18 components with responsibilities, interfaces)
       - Section 4: Quality Attributes (performance, security, scalability, maintainability)
       - Section 5: Deployment (infrastructure, environments, CI/CD pipeline)
       - Section 6: Traceability (requirements → architecture mapping)
     - Saves draft: `.aiwg/working/architecture/sad/drafts/v0.1-primary-draft.md`
   - Orchestrator confirms completion: "SAD v0.1 draft complete (3,245 words, 18 components, 6 sections)"

5. **Orchestrator launches parallel reviewers (4 simultaneous agents)**
   - Orchestrator prepares parallel execution:
     - Reviewer 1: Security Architect (validates security patterns, threat models, data classification)
     - Reviewer 2: Test Architect (validates testability, component boundaries, test seams)
     - Reviewer 3: Requirements Analyst (validates traceability, completeness, coverage)
     - Reviewer 4: Technical Writer (validates clarity, consistency, terminology)
   - **CRITICAL: Single message with 4 Task calls (parallel execution pattern)**
   - Orchestrator launches all 4 reviewers simultaneously:
     - Task 1 (Security Architect): "Read SAD draft from `.aiwg/working/architecture/sad/drafts/v0.1-primary-draft.md`. Validate: 1) Threat models complete, 2) Data classification defined, 3) Authentication/authorization patterns secure, 4) Encryption strategies documented. Save review to: `.aiwg/working/architecture/sad/reviews/security-architect-review.md` with verdict: APPROVED, CONDITIONAL, or REJECTED."
     - Task 2 (Test Architect): "Read SAD draft. Validate: 1) Component boundaries testable, 2) Test seams identified, 3) Mock strategies defined, 4) Integration test approach documented. Save review to: `.aiwg/working/architecture/sad/reviews/test-architect-review.md`."
     - Task 3 (Requirements Analyst): "Read SAD draft. Validate: 1) All 11 use cases traced to components, 2) All 60 NFRs addressed, 3) Traceability matrix complete, 4) No orphan requirements. Save review to: `.aiwg/working/architecture/sad/reviews/requirements-analyst-review.md`."
     - Task 4 (Technical Writer): "Read SAD draft. Validate: 1) Clarity (readability, structure), 2) Consistency (terminology, formatting), 3) Completeness (no missing sections), 4) Diagrams accurate. Save review to: `.aiwg/working/architecture/sad/reviews/technical-writer-review.md`."
   - Orchestrator logs parallel launch: "Parallel reviewers launched (4 agents executing simultaneously)"

6. **Orchestrator monitors reviewer completion**
   - Orchestrator waits for all 4 reviewers to complete
   - Reviewer completion order (asynchronous):
     - Technical Writer: APPROVED (2 minutes, 485 words)
     - Test Architect: CONDITIONAL (3 minutes, 620 words - "Add performance test strategy section")
     - Security Architect: APPROVED (4 minutes, 730 words)
     - Requirements Analyst: APPROVED (5 minutes, 892 words)
   - Orchestrator tracks completion: "4/4 reviews complete (3 APPROVED, 1 CONDITIONAL)"
   - Orchestrator calculates approval rate: 75% APPROVED (3/4) → MEETS 75% threshold

7. **Orchestrator validates approval threshold**
   - Orchestrator checks Business Rule BR-MA-002 (Approval Thresholds):
     - Current approval rate: 75% (3/4 APPROVED)
     - Threshold: 75% required for synthesis
     - Result: THRESHOLD MET → Proceed to synthesis
   - Orchestrator logs validation: "Approval threshold met (75% ≥ 75%). Proceeding to synthesis."
   - Orchestrator extracts conditional feedback:
     - Test Architect: "Add performance test strategy section (response time targets, load test scenarios, performance benchmarks)"

8. **Orchestrator launches Synthesizer agent**
   - Orchestrator launches Documentation Synthesizer via Task tool:
     - Task description: "Synthesize SAD from primary draft and 4 reviewer feedback documents"
     - Prompt: "Read primary draft: `.aiwg/working/architecture/sad/drafts/v0.1-primary-draft.md`. Read 4 reviews from `.aiwg/working/architecture/sad/reviews/`. Merge feedback: 1) Incorporate APPROVED suggestions, 2) Resolve CONDITIONAL items (add performance test strategy section), 3) Flag REJECTED items for user decision. Generate final SAD: `.aiwg/architecture/software-architecture-doc.md` (BASELINED). Log synthesis decisions: `.aiwg/working/architecture/sad/logs/synthesis-log.md`."
   - Documentation Synthesizer executes:
     - Reads v0.1 draft (3,245 words)
     - Reads 4 reviews (total 2,727 words of feedback)
     - Merges feedback:
       - Security Architect suggestions: Added threat model section (Section 4.3)
       - Test Architect requirement: Added performance test strategy (Section 5.4)
       - Requirements Analyst suggestions: Enhanced traceability matrix (Section 6.2)
       - Technical Writer suggestions: Improved diagram clarity (updated 5 diagrams)
     - Generates final SAD (3,987 words, 19 components, 7 sections)
     - Logs synthesis decisions: `.aiwg/working/architecture/sad/logs/synthesis-log.md` (documenting all merge decisions)
   - Orchestrator confirms synthesis: "SAD BASELINED: `.aiwg/architecture/software-architecture-doc.md` (3,987 words, 4 reviewer sign-offs)"

9. **Orchestrator updates traceability matrix**
   - Orchestrator invokes traceability validation:
     - Reads requirements baseline: 11 use cases, 60 NFRs
     - Reads BASELINED SAD: 19 components, 7 sections
     - Maps requirements → architecture:
       - UC-001 → Component: Authentication Service (Section 3.2)
       - UC-002 → Component: Workflow Orchestrator (Section 3.3)
       - NFR-PERF-001 → Section 4.1 (Performance Attributes, <90s validation target)
       - ... (all 71 requirements mapped)
     - Updates traceability matrix CSV: `.aiwg/traceability/requirements-traceability-matrix.csv`
   - Orchestrator validates coverage: 100% requirements coverage (71/71 requirements mapped to SAD)
   - Orchestrator logs traceability: "Traceability matrix updated. 100% requirements coverage (71/71 mapped to SAD sections/components)."

10. **Orchestrator archives working artifacts**
    - Orchestrator moves working artifacts to archive:
      - From: `.aiwg/working/architecture/sad/`

## 9. Alternate Flows

### Alt-1: Extended Review Cycle (Additional Reviewers)

**Branch Point:** Step 5 (Orchestrator launches parallel reviewers)
**Condition:** User specifies custom reviewer panel (more than 4 reviewers)

**Flow:**
1. User requests: "Create SAD with performance focus. Add performance-engineer and devops-engineer to review panel."
2. Orchestrator parses custom request:
   - Default reviewers: Security Architect, Test Architect, Requirements Analyst, Technical Writer
   - Custom reviewers: Performance Engineer, DevOps Engineer
   - Total reviewers: 6 agents
3. Orchestrator adjusts approval threshold:
   - 75% of 6 reviewers = 4.5 → rounds to 5 reviewers (83% approval required)
4. Orchestrator launches 6 reviewers in parallel (single message, 6 Task calls):
   - Default 4 + Performance Engineer + DevOps Engineer
5. Reviewers complete:
   - Security Architect: APPROVED
   - Test Architect: APPROVED
   - Requirements Analyst: APPROVED
   - Technical Writer: APPROVED
   - Performance Engineer: CONDITIONAL ("Add performance benchmarks section")
   - DevOps Engineer: APPROVED
6. Orchestrator calculates approval: 5/6 APPROVED (83%) → MEETS 83% threshold
7. Orchestrator logs extended review: "Extended review cycle complete. 6 reviewers (5 APPROVED, 1 CONDITIONAL, 83% approval rate)."
8. **Resume Main Flow:** Step 8 (Synthesizer merges 6 reviews instead of 4)

**Alternate Outcome:**
- SAD includes performance benchmarks section (Performance Engineer feedback)
- SAD includes deployment automation guidance (DevOps Engineer feedback)
- Extended review completes in 20 minutes (vs 17 minutes for standard 4-reviewer workflow)

### Alt-2: Partial Agent Availability (Reviewer Substitution)

**Branch Point:** Step 5 (Orchestrator launches parallel reviewers)
**Condition:** 1 reviewer agent unavailable (file missing, agent disabled)

**Flow:**
1. Orchestrator attempts to launch 4 reviewers
2. Security Architect agent file missing: `.claude/agents/security-architect.md` not found
3. Orchestrator detects agent unavailability
4. Orchestrator identifies substitute agent:
   - Primary substitute: Security Gatekeeper (similar role)
   - Secondary substitute: DevOps Engineer (has security validation capabilities)
5. Orchestrator prompts user: "Security Architect unavailable. Substitute with Security Gatekeeper? (y/n)"
6. User confirms: "y" (yes, use Security Gatekeeper)
7. Orchestrator launches 4 reviewers with substitution:
   - Security Gatekeeper (substitute for Security Architect)
   - Test Architect
   - Requirements Analyst
   - Technical Writer
8. Reviewers complete with substitution
9. Orchestrator logs substitution: "Reviewer substitution: Security Gatekeeper replaced Security Architect (agent unavailable)"
10. **Resume Main Flow:** Step 6 (Monitor reviewer completion)

**Alternate Outcome:**
- Security validation completed by Security Gatekeeper (focuses on compliance vs Security Architect's focus on architecture)
- Audit trail includes substitution note (compliance tracking)

### Alt-3: Override Consensus (User Decision on Reviewer Conflict)

**Branch Point:** Step 7 (Orchestrator validates approval threshold)
**Condition:** Approval rate below 75% threshold (2/4 APPROVED = 50%)

**Flow:**
1. Parallel reviewers complete:
   - Security Architect: REJECTED ("Missing threat model section - BLOCKER")
   - Test Architect: APPROVED
   - Requirements Analyst: REJECTED ("Incomplete traceability - 45/71 requirements missing")
   - Technical Writer: APPROVED
2. Orchestrator calculates approval: 2/4 APPROVED (50%) → BELOW 75% threshold
3. Orchestrator detects threshold violation
4. Orchestrator launches Consensus Facilitator:
   - Analyzes conflicting feedback (Security Architect vs Requirements Analyst rejections)
   - Identifies issues:
     - Issue 1: Missing threat model section (Security Architect)
     - Issue 2: Incomplete traceability (Requirements Analyst)
   - Classifies issues:
     - Issue 1: BLOCKER (security requirement)
     - Issue 2: BLOCKER (compliance requirement)
5. Orchestrator prompts user with conflict resolution options:
   ```
   ⚠️ Consensus conflict detected (50% approval, threshold: 75%)

   Rejections:
   - Security Architect: Missing threat model section (BLOCKER)
   - Requirements Analyst: Incomplete traceability - 45/71 requirements missing (BLOCKER)

   Options:
   1. Revise and re-review (relaunch Primary Author to address issues, then re-review)
   2. Override rejections (proceed with warning, manual resolution required)
   3. Abort workflow (cancel artifact generation)
   ```
6. User chooses: "1 - Revise and re-review"
7. Orchestrator relaunches Primary Author (Architecture Designer):
   - Prompt: "Revise SAD to address reviewer rejections: 1) Add threat model section (Section 4.3), 2) Complete traceability (map all 71 requirements to components)"
8. Architecture Designer revises draft (v0.2):
   - Adds threat model section (Section 4.3, 1,200 words)
   - Completes traceability matrix (maps remaining 26 requirements)
   - Saves revision: `.aiwg/working/architecture/sad/drafts/v0.2-revised-draft.md`
9. Orchestrator relaunches Security Architect and Requirements Analyst (re-review):
   - Security Architect: APPROVED ("Threat model section complete")
   - Requirements Analyst: APPROVED ("100% traceability achieved - 71/71 requirements mapped")
10. Orchestrator recalculates approval: 4/4 APPROVED (100%) → EXCEEDS 75% threshold
11. Orchestrator logs consensus resolution: "Consensus conflict resolved. Revised draft v0.2 → 4/4 APPROVED (100% approval rate)."
12. **Resume Main Flow:** Step 8 (Synthesizer merges v0.2 draft + 4 reviews)

**Alternate Outcome:**
- Revised draft (v0.2) includes threat model section and complete traceability
- Re-review cycle adds 10 minutes to workflow (total 27 minutes vs 17 minutes)
- Final SAD includes all required sections (no missing content)

## 10. Exception Flows

### Exc-1: Requirements Baseline Missing (Initialization Failure)

**Trigger:** Step 1 (Orchestrator validates preconditions)
**Condition:** `.aiwg/requirements/` directory missing or empty (no requirements to trace)

**Flow:**
1. Orchestrator validates preconditions
2. Orchestrator attempts to read requirements baseline: `.aiwg/requirements/`
3. Directory not found error (or directory exists but contains zero `.md` files)
4. Orchestrator detects missing requirements baseline
5. Orchestrator displays error message:
   ```
   ❌ Multi-agent workflow initialization failed

   Error: Requirements baseline missing
   Expected directory: .aiwg/requirements/
   Status: NOT FOUND (or EMPTY)

   Multi-agent workflows require requirements baseline to validate traceability.

   Remediation Steps:
   1. Run `/project:intake-wizard` to generate project intake and requirements
   2. Run `/project:intake-start` to create requirements baseline from intake forms
   3. Manually create requirements in `.aiwg/requirements/use-cases/` and `.aiwg/requirements/nfrs/`
   4. Re-run multi-agent workflow after requirements baseline exists
   ```
6. Orchestrator logs error: `.aiwg/working/orchestration-errors.log`
   - Entry: `2025-10-22 15:30:00 | ERROR | Requirements baseline missing - cannot initialize multi-agent workflow`
7. Orchestrator exits with status code: `1` (error - baseline required)

**Expected Result:** User creates requirements baseline before re-running multi-agent workflow

### Exc-2: Primary Author Agent Timeout (Resource Exhaustion)

**Trigger:** Step 4 (Primary Author generates initial draft)
**Condition:** Primary Author exceeds 30-minute timeout (complex artifact, large codebase)

**Flow:**
1. Orchestrator launches Architecture Designer
2. Architecture Designer begins SAD generation
3. Draft generation exceeds 30-minute timeout (complex codebase, 200+ requirements, 50+ components)
4. Orchestrator detects timeout
5. Orchestrator logs timeout: `.aiwg/working/architecture/sad/logs/primary-author-timeout.log`
   - Entry: `2025-10-22 15:45:00 | ERROR | Primary Author timeout (30 minutes exceeded). Artifact: SAD. Agent: Architecture Designer.`
6. Orchestrator retries with chunked generation strategy:
   - Chunk 1: System Overview + Architecture Views (Sections 1-2)
   - Chunk 2: Component Design (Section 3)
   - Chunk 3: Quality Attributes + Deployment (Sections 4-5)
   - Chunk 4: Traceability + Glossary (Sections 6-7)
7. Orchestrator launches Architecture Designer 4 times (sequential chunked generation):
   - Chunk 1 completes in 8 minutes
   - Chunk 2 completes in 12 minutes
   - Chunk 3 completes in 7 minutes
   - Chunk 4 completes in 5 minutes
   - Total: 32 minutes (exceeds original 30-minute timeout, but chunked strategy succeeds)
8. Orchestrator merges chunks into single draft: `.aiwg/working/architecture/sad/drafts/v0.1-primary-draft.md`
9. Orchestrator logs chunked generation: "Primary Author timeout recovered. Chunked generation strategy used (4 chunks, 32 minutes total)."
10. **Resume Main Flow:** Step 5 (Launch parallel reviewers)

**Expected Result:** Chunked generation strategy recovers from timeout, draft generated successfully

### Exc-3: Reviewer Agent Crash (Agent Execution Failure)

**Trigger:** Step 5 (Orchestrator launches parallel reviewers)
**Condition:** 1 of 4 reviewers crashes (exception, resource exhaustion, agent error)

**Flow:**
1. Orchestrator launches 4 parallel reviewers
2. Security Architect agent crashes mid-execution (exception: out of memory, invalid file path, corrupted draft)
3. Orchestrator detects crash (Task tool returns error)
4. Orchestrator logs crash: `.aiwg/working/architecture/sad/logs/reviewer-crash.log`
   - Entry: `2025-10-22 15:32:18 | ERROR | Reviewer crash: Security Architect. Error: Out of memory. Artifact: SAD.`
5. Orchestrator retries Security Architect (1 retry attempt):
   - Retry with reduced context (chunked review: read only Section 4 Quality Attributes instead of full 3,987-word draft)
6. Retry succeeds: Security Architect completes review (validated Section 4 only, partial review)
7. Orchestrator logs retry: "Reviewer crash recovered. Security Architect retry successful (partial review: Section 4 only)."
8. Orchestrator marks Security Architect review as PARTIAL (not full review)
9. Orchestrator adjusts approval calculation:
   - Full reviews: 3 (Test Architect, Requirements Analyst, Technical Writer)
   - Partial reviews: 1 (Security Architect - Section 4 only)
   - Effective approval rate: 75% (3 full + 0.5 partial = 3.5/4 = 87.5%)
10. Orchestrator displays warning:
    ```
    ⚠️ Partial review detected

    Reviewer: Security Architect (crashed, retry partial review)
    Coverage: Section 4 (Quality Attributes) only
    Verdict: APPROVED (partial review)

    Impact: Full security validation incomplete (Sections 1-3, 5-7 not validated by Security Architect)
    Recommendation: Manual security review for unvalidated sections OR re-run workflow after resolving crash
    ```
11. **Resume Main Flow:** Step 6 (Monitor reviewer completion with partial review)

**Expected Result:** Partial review accepted, warning issued, user decides whether to accept partial review or re-run

### Exc-4: Agent Communication Timeout (Reviewer SLA Violation)

**Trigger:** Step 6 (Orchestrator monitors reviewer completion)
**Condition:** 1 of 4 reviewers exceeds 10-minute SLA (Service Level Agreement for reviewer response time)

**Flow:**
1. Orchestrator launches 4 parallel reviewers
2. Reviewers complete in order:
   - Technical Writer: APPROVED (2 minutes)
   - Test Architect: CONDITIONAL (3 minutes)
   - Security Architect: APPROVED (4 minutes)
   - Requirements Analyst: **TIMEOUT** (exceeds 10-minute SLA, still executing)
3. Orchestrator detects timeout at 10 minutes
4. Orchestrator logs timeout: `.aiwg/working/architecture/sad/logs/reviewer-timeout.log`
   - Entry: `2025-10-22 15:32:45 | WARNING | Reviewer timeout: Requirements Analyst. SLA: 10 minutes. Status: Still executing.`
5. Orchestrator waits additional 5 minutes (grace period)
6. Requirements Analyst completes at 13 minutes (3 minutes beyond SLA)
7. Orchestrator logs SLA violation: "Requirements Analyst SLA violated (13 minutes, SLA: 10 minutes, 30% delay)."
8. Orchestrator marks Requirements Analyst review as DELAYED (flag for performance tracking)
9. Orchestrator includes SLA violation in summary report:
   - "1/4 reviewers exceeded SLA (Requirements Analyst: 13 minutes, 30% delay)"
10. **Resume Main Flow:** Step 7 (Validate approval threshold with all 4 reviews complete, including delayed review)

**Expected Result:** Delayed review accepted, SLA violation logged for performance tracking, workflow completes successfully

### Exc-5: Conflicting Review Feedback (Security vs Performance Trade-off)

**Trigger:** Step 8 (Orchestrator launches Synthesizer)
**Condition:** Synthesizer detects conflicting feedback (irreconcilable trade-offs)

**Flow:**
1. Synthesizer reads 4 reviews
2. Synthesizer identifies conflicting feedback:
   - Security Architect: "Use AES-256 encryption for all data at rest (high security, performance impact)"
   - Performance Engineer (custom reviewer): "Avoid encryption for performance-critical data (low latency requirement <10ms)"
3. Synthesizer classifies conflict as TRADE-OFF (security vs performance, no clear resolution)
4. Synthesizer flags unresolvable conflict:
   - "Conflict: AES-256 encryption (Security Architect) vs No encryption (Performance Engineer). Trade-off: Security vs Performance."
5. Synthesizer prompts user for decision:
   ```
   ⚠️ Conflicting review feedback detected

   Conflict: Data encryption strategy
   - Security Architect: Use AES-256 encryption for all data (high security, performance impact)
   - Performance Engineer: Avoid encryption for performance-critical data (low latency <10ms)

   Trade-off: Security vs Performance

   Options:
   1. Prioritize security (AES-256 encryption, accept performance impact)
   2. Prioritize performance (no encryption, accept security risk)
   3. Hybrid approach (encrypt non-performance-critical data only)
   ```
6. User chooses: "3 - Hybrid approach (encrypt non-performance-critical data, exclude performance-critical data)"
7. Synthesizer incorporates user decision:
   - Section 4.2 (Security): "Encryption strategy - Hybrid approach: AES-256 encryption for user data (non-performance-critical). No encryption for real-time event logs (performance-critical, <10ms latency requirement)."
8. Synthesizer logs user decision: `.aiwg/working/architecture/sad/logs/synthesis-log.md`
   - Entry: `User decision: Hybrid encryption strategy (AES-256 for user data, no encryption for event logs). Resolves Security Architect vs Performance Engineer conflict.`
9. **Resume Main Flow:** Step 9 (Update traceability matrix with hybrid approach documented)

**Expected Result:** User-guided conflict resolution, hybrid approach documented in SAD, synthesis completes successfully

### Exc-6: Synthesizer Merge Conflict (Incompatible Recommendations)

**Trigger:** Step 8 (Orchestrator launches Synthesizer)
**Condition:** Synthesizer cannot merge incompatible architectural recommendations

**Flow:**
1. Synthesizer reads 4 reviews
2. Synthesizer identifies incompatible recommendations:
   - Security Architect: "Use OAuth2 for authentication (enterprise requirement)"
   - Requirements Analyst: "Use SAML for authentication (per NFR-SEC-003, enterprise SSO requirement)"
3. Synthesizer classifies conflict as INCOMPATIBLE (contradictory authentication strategies, mutual exclusion)
4. Synthesizer attempts automatic resolution:
   - Check requirements baseline: NFR-SEC-003 specifies SAML (explicit requirement)
   - Check priority: Requirements Analyst reference to NFR-SEC-003 (explicit requirement) > Security Architect suggestion (recommendation)
5. Synthesizer resolves conflict automatically:
   - Decision: SAML (per NFR-SEC-003, explicit requirement takes precedence over recommendation)
6. Synthesizer logs automatic resolution: `.aiwg/working/architecture/sad/logs/synthesis-log.md`
   - Entry: `Automatic resolution: SAML authentication (per NFR-SEC-003) takes precedence over OAuth2 (Security Architect suggestion). Rationale: Explicit requirement > recommendation.`
7. Synthesizer incorporates SAML authentication in final SAD:
   - Section 3.2 (Authentication Service): "SAML-based authentication (per NFR-SEC-003, enterprise SSO requirement)"
8. **Resume Main Flow:** Step 9 (Update traceability matrix with SAML authentication)

**Expected Result:** Synthesizer auto-resolves conflict using requirements baseline priority, SAML documented in SAD

### Exc-7: Context Window Exhaustion (Large Artifact Review)

**Trigger:** Step 5 (Orchestrator launches parallel reviewers)
**Condition:** SAD draft >10,000 words exceeds reviewer context window limits

**Flow:**
1. Primary Author generates large SAD draft (12,000 words, 50+ components, complex architecture)
2. Orchestrator attempts to launch 4 parallel reviewers
3. Reviewers fail to load full draft (context window exhaustion, >10,000 words exceeds reviewer capacity)
4. Orchestrator detects context exhaustion
5. Orchestrator logs context exhaustion: `.aiwg/working/architecture/sad/logs/context-exhaustion.log`
   - Entry: `2025-10-22 15:35:00 | WARNING | Context window exhaustion. Draft size: 12,000 words (limit: 10,000 words). Chunking required.`
6. Orchestrator chunks SAD into sections for review:
   - Section 1: System Overview (2,000 words)
   - Section 2: Architecture Views (3,000 words)
   - Section 3: Component Design (4,000 words)
   - Section 4: Quality Attributes (2,000 words)
   - Section 5: Deployment + Traceability (1,000 words)
7. Orchestrator launches chunked review (5 sections × 4 reviewers = 20 parallel tasks):
   - Security Architect reviews all 5 sections (5 tasks)
   - Test Architect reviews all 5 sections (5 tasks)
   - Requirements Analyst reviews all 5 sections (5 tasks)
   - Technical Writer reviews all 5 sections (5 tasks)
8. Orchestrator manages parallel execution within 25-agent limit:
   - Batch 1: 20 tasks (5 sections × 4 reviewers) - launches first 20 tasks
   - (No Batch 2 needed, 20 tasks within 25-agent limit)
9. Chunked reviews complete:
   - Each reviewer provides 5 section-specific reviews (total: 20 review files)
10. Synthesizer merges section reviews into comprehensive feedback:
    - Combines Security Architect's 5 section reviews into single security validation
    - Combines Test Architect's 5 section reviews into single testability validation
    - Combines Requirements Analyst's 5 section reviews into single traceability validation
    - Combines Technical Writer's 5 section reviews into single clarity validation
11. Orchestrator logs chunked review: "Context window exhaustion recovered. Chunked review strategy used (5 sections, 20 tasks, 18 minutes total)."
12. **Resume Main Flow:** Step 7 (Validate approval threshold with merged section reviews)

**Expected Result:** Chunked review strategy recovers from context exhaustion, all sections validated, workflow completes successfully

2. **Scenario 2**: Primary Author timeout (Exc-2)
   - Verify error logged: `.aiwg/working/architecture/sad/logs/primary-author-timeout.log`
   - Verify log entry: "Primary Author timeout (30 minutes exceeded)"
3. **Scenario 3**: Reviewer crash (Exc-3)
   - Verify error logged: `.aiwg/working/architecture/sad/logs/reviewer-crash.log`
   - Verify log entry: "Reviewer crash: Security Architect. Error: Out of memory."
4. Verify all errors logged with:
   - Timestamp
   - Error type/description
   - Context (artifact, agent, step)
   - Remediation (if applicable)
**Expected Result:** 100% errors logged with complete metadata
**NFR Validated:** NFR-MA-10 (Error logging 100%)
**Pass/Fail:** PASS if all errors logged

### TC-004-028: Graceful Degradation (Partial Results)

**Objective:** Validate graceful degradation (partial results better than no results)
**Preconditions:** Workflow with agent failures (crash, timeout)
**Test Steps:**
1. Configure multiple agent failures:
   - Primary Author: Timeout (chunked generation recovers)
   - Security Architect: Crash (partial review recovers)
   - Requirements Analyst: SLA violation (delayed review accepted)
2. Wait for workflow completion
3. Verify workflow completes despite 3 agent issues
4. Verify partial results preserved:
   - Chunked draft (Primary Author recovery)
   - Partial review (Security Architect recovery)
   - Delayed review (Requirements Analyst acceptance)
5. Verify warnings issued for all partial results
6. Verify BASELINED artifact generated (despite partial results)
**Expected Result:** Workflow completes with partial results, warnings issued
**NFR Validated:** NFR-MA-09 (Graceful degradation)
**Pass/Fail:** PASS if workflow completes with partial results

### TC-004-029: Reviewer Timeout Retry (1 Attempt)

**Objective:** Validate reviewer timeout retry policy (1 retry attempt)
**Preconditions:** Reviewer exceeds 30-minute hard timeout
**Test Steps:**
1. Configure Security Architect to timeout (mock 35-minute execution)
2. Wait for Orchestrator to detect timeout at 30 minutes (Exc-1)
3. Verify Orchestrator logs timeout: `.aiwg/working/architecture/sad/logs/reviewer-timeout.log`
4. Verify Orchestrator retries Security Architect (1 retry attempt)
5. **Scenario 1**: Retry succeeds (reviewer completes in 8 minutes)
   - Verify workflow proceeds with retry review
6. **Scenario 2**: Retry fails (reviewer times out again)
   - Verify Orchestrator aborts retry (1 retry limit)
   - Verify Orchestrator proceeds with 3/4 reviews (graceful degradation)
   - Verify warning issued: "Security Architect timeout (retry failed). Proceeding with 3/4 reviews."
**Expected Result:** 1 retry attempted, graceful degradation if retry fails
**NFR Validated:** NFR-MA-08 (Agent timeout handling, 1 retry)
**Pass/Fail:** PASS if retry logic behaves correctly

### TC-004-030: End-to-End Multi-Agent Workflow

**Objective:** Validate complete end-to-end multi-agent workflow
**Preconditions:** AIWG project with requirements, SDLC agents deployed
**Test Steps:**
1. User requests: "Create architecture baseline"
2. Wait for workflow completion (Steps 1-12)
3. Verify all workflow steps execute:
   - Step 1: User initiates workflow
   - Step 2: Orchestrator initializes workspace
   - Step 3: Orchestrator selects Primary Author
   - Step 4: Primary Author generates draft (v0.1)
   - Step 5: Orchestrator launches 4 parallel reviewers
   - Step 6: Orchestrator monitors reviewer completion
   - Step 7: Orchestrator validates approval threshold
   - Step 8: Orchestrator launches Synthesizer
   - Step 9: Orchestrator updates traceability matrix
   - Step 10: Orchestrator archives working artifacts
   - Step 11: Orchestrator reports workflow summary
   - Step 12: User reviews BASELINED artifact
4. Verify all outputs generated:
   - Primary draft: `.aiwg/working/architecture/sad/drafts/v0.1-primary-draft.md`
   - 4 reviewer feedback files: `.aiwg/working/architecture/sad/reviews/{role}-review.md`
   - BASELINED SAD: `.aiwg/architecture/software-architecture-doc.md`
   - Traceability matrix: `.aiwg/traceability/requirements-traceability-matrix.csv`
   - Archive: `.aiwg/archive/architecture/sad-generation-YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS/`
5. Verify quality validation:
   - Security: VALIDATED (threat models complete)
   - Testability: VALIDATED (component boundaries testable)
   - Traceability: VALIDATED (100% requirements coverage)
   - Clarity: VALIDATED (readable, consistent)
6. Verify workflow metrics:
   - Total time: 15-20 minutes
