## 1. Use-Case Identifier and Name

**ID:** UC-003
**Name:** Generate Intake Documents from Existing Codebase via `/project:intake-from-codebase`

## 2. Scope and Level

**Scope:** AIWG Framework Brownfield Project Intake System
**Level:** User Goal
**System Boundary:** AIWG framework repository, codebase analyzer, git repository, file system (README, package.json, source code), intake document generators

## 3. Primary Actor(s)

**Primary Actors:**
- **Solo Developer**: Individual formalizing an existing personal project (no prior documentation, wants SDLC structure)
- **Technical Lead**: Developer inheriting a legacy codebase (sparse documentation, wants to understand architecture)
- **Project Manager**: Manager documenting an undocumented system (for compliance, audit, or team onboarding)
- **Enterprise Team Lead**: Manager migrating existing system to AIWG SDLC framework (standardization across teams)
- **Consultant**: External consultant analyzing client codebase for assessment (due diligence, modernization planning)

**Actor Goals:**
- Generate comprehensive intake documents from existing codebase (save 8-12 hours manual documentation)
- Infer project vision, goals, and stakeholders from git history and code patterns
- Extract technical architecture from code structure, dependencies, and frameworks
- Identify compliance requirements from codebase patterns (HIPAA, SOC2, GDPR indicators)
- Achieve 80-90% field accuracy to minimize manual edits (<2 hours validation)
- Accelerate Inception phase kickoff for brownfield projects (same-day intake completion)

## 4. Stakeholders and Interests

| Stakeholder | Interest |
|------------|----------|
| Solo Developer | Fast-track SDLC adoption (skip manual intake forms, focus on building) |
| Technical Lead | Understand inherited legacy codebase (architecture, risks, technical debt) |
| Project Manager | Compliance documentation (audit trail for existing systems) |
| Enterprise Team | Standardization (all projects using AIWG intake format) |
| Consultant | Client assessment (rapid codebase analysis for proposals) |
| Auditor (External) | Documentation completeness (brownfield projects need same rigor as greenfield) |

## 5. Preconditions

1. Existing codebase with git repository (`.git` directory exists)
2. Git history with 10+ commits (minimum for meaningful inference)
3. AIWG SDLC commands deployed (`.claude/commands/intake-from-codebase.md`)
4. Core Orchestrator (Claude Code) has read access to project files
5. Typical project artifacts present:
   - README.md (project description, installation instructions)
   - Package manager files (package.json, requirements.txt, pom.xml, Gemfile)
   - Source code files (.js, .py, .java, .rb, .go, .rs)
   - Configuration files (.env.example, config.yaml, settings.json)
6. `.aiwg/` directory does not exist yet (or user confirms overwrite)
7. User in project root directory (current working directory = project root)

## 6. Postconditions

**Success Postconditions:**
- 3 intake documents generated:
  - `project-intake.md` (vision, goals, stakeholders, business context)
  - `technical-intake.md` (tech stack, architecture, dependencies, deployment)
  - `stakeholder-intake.md` (personas, team structure, roles, skill levels)
- All documents saved to `.aiwg/intake/` directory
- Field accuracy 80-90% (user edits <20% of fields)
- Critical fields 100% populated (project name, tech stack, primary language, repository URL)
- Confidence scores assigned to each field (High: 90%+, Medium: 70-89%, Low: <70%)
- Low-confidence fields flagged for user review (marked with `⚠️ LOW CONFIDENCE` indicator)
- Analysis completes in <5 minutes for 1,000-file repositories
- Ready for Inception phase validation (`/project:intake-start`)
- Optional: Remediation recommendations generated for technical debt, security risks

**Failure Postconditions:**
- Error log generated: `.aiwg/intake/generation-errors.log`
- Partial intake documents saved (best-effort completion)
- Remediation recommendations provided:
  - Insufficient git history (<10 commits) → "Add more commits or use `/project:intake-wizard` for manual intake"
  - Missing README.md → "Create README.md with project description, installation instructions"
  - No package manager files → "Add package.json (Node.js) or requirements.txt (Python) for dependency analysis"
- User notified of completion percentage (e.g., "75% fields populated, 25% low confidence")

## 7. Trigger

**Manual Triggers:**
- Developer invokes: `/project:intake-from-codebase .` (current directory)
- Developer invokes: `/project:intake-from-codebase /path/to/project` (specific path)
- Developer invokes: `/project:intake-from-codebase . --interactive` (guided refinement mode)
- Developer invokes: `/project:intake-from-codebase . --guidance "Focus on security, SOC2 audit in 3 months"` (strategic focus)

**Automatic Triggers:**
- CI/CD pipeline post-migration: Automatically generate intake for newly migrated legacy projects
- Scheduled audit: Quarterly codebase documentation refresh for all brownfield projects

**Event Triggers:**
- New team member onboarding (generate intake for context)
- Compliance audit request (document existing systems)
- Technical debt assessment (analyze codebase health)

## 8. Main Success Scenario

**Alternate Outcome:**
- Intake confidence improved from 75% to 91% (16-point improvement)
- User spent 5-8 minutes answering 4 strategic questions (faster than manual intake)
- Ready for validation with minimal manual edits

### Alt-2: Guidance Parameter (Strategic Focus)

**Branch Point:** Step 2 (Developer initiates intake generation)
**Condition:** User provides `--guidance` parameter with strategic focus

**Flow:**
1. User invokes: `/project:intake-from-codebase . --guidance "Focus on security posture and compliance gaps for SOC2 audit in 3 months"`
2. System parses guidance text:
   - Focus areas: Security posture, Compliance gaps
   - Compliance framework: SOC2
   - Timeline: 3 months (tight deadline)
3. System prioritizes security analysis (Step 9 from Main Flow):
   - Deep scan for security patterns: HTTPS, authentication, authorization, encryption
   - Scan for audit logs: Access logs, change logs, error logs
   - Scan for access control: Role-based permissions, least privilege
   - Scan for data encryption: Encryption at rest, encryption in transit
4. System generates security-focused intake:
   - Technical intake includes expanded security section:
     - **Current Security Posture**: HTTPS + JWT + bcrypt, 85% coverage (3 gaps identified)
     - **SOC2 Gaps**: Missing audit logs (2 gaps), Missing encryption at rest (1 gap), Missing access control matrix (1 gap)
     - **Remediation Plan**: Add audit logging (2 weeks), Enable database encryption (1 week), Create access control matrix (1 week)
   - Project intake includes compliance-focused business goals:
     - **Business Goal 1**: Achieve SOC2 Type 2 certification within 3 months (compliance driver)
     - **Success Criteria 1**: 100% SOC2 controls implemented (zero findings in audit)
5. System assigns high confidence to security fields (95%+):
   - Security posture: 98% (directly scanned from codebase)
   - SOC2 gaps: 92% (identified from control checklist)
   - Remediation plan: 90% (estimated effort based on gap complexity)
6. System flags security risks:
   - **Risk 1**: Missing audit logs (SOC2 CC7.2 control violation)
   - **Risk 2**: No encryption at rest (SOC2 CC6.1 control violation)
   - **Risk 3**: No access control matrix (SOC2 CC6.2 control violation)
7. System displays security-focused summary:
   ```
   ✅ Security-focused intake generation complete

   Security Posture: 85% (3 SOC2 gaps identified)

   SOC2 Gaps (requires remediation):
   - Missing audit logs (CC7.2) - Priority: HIGH (audit blocker)
   - Missing encryption at rest (CC6.1) - Priority: HIGH (data protection)
   - Missing access control matrix (CC6.2) - Priority: MEDIUM (documentation gap)

### Alt-3: Monorepo Detected (Multiple Projects in Single Repo)

**Branch Point:** Step 5 (System scans codebase structure)
**Condition:** Monorepo detected (packages/ directory with multiple package.json files)

**Flow:**
1. System scans codebase structure (Step 5)
2. System detects monorepo pattern:
   - `packages/` directory exists
   - Multiple `package.json` files (5 packages detected)
   - Lerna or Yarn workspaces configuration (`lerna.json` or `"workspaces"` in root package.json)
3. System identifies monorepo packages:
   - `packages/frontend/` (React application)
   - `packages/backend/` (Express API)
   - `packages/shared/` (Shared utilities library)
   - `packages/cli/` (CLI tool)
   - `packages/docs/` (Documentation site)
4. System prompts user for scope selection:
   ```
   Monorepo detected (5 packages). Generate intake for:
   (A) All packages (5 separate intake documents)
   (B) Specific package (select package name)
   (C) Root project only (treat as unified project)
   ```
5. User selects: "A - All packages"
6. System generates 5 sets of intake documents:
   - `.aiwg/intake/frontend/` (project-intake.md, technical-intake.md, stakeholder-intake.md)
   - `.aiwg/intake/backend/` (project-intake.md, technical-intake.md, stakeholder-intake.md)
   - `.aiwg/intake/shared/` (library-focused intake)
   - `.aiwg/intake/cli/` (CLI-focused intake)
   - `.aiwg/intake/docs/` (documentation-focused intake)
7. System analyzes cross-package dependencies:
   - `frontend` depends on `shared` (dependency graph edge)
   - `backend` depends on `shared` (dependency graph edge)
   - `cli` depends on `shared` (dependency graph edge)
8. System generates monorepo summary:
   ```
   ✅ Monorepo intake generation complete (5 packages)

   Packages:
   - frontend (React 18, 142 commits, 3 contributors)
   - backend (Express 4, 198 commits, 4 contributors)
   - shared (Utility library, 87 commits, 5 contributors)
   - cli (Node.js CLI, 45 commits, 2 contributors)
   - docs (VitePress, 23 commits, 2 contributors)

   Cross-Package Dependencies:
   - frontend → shared (UI utilities)
   - backend → shared (validation, logging)
   - cli → shared (configuration parser)

   Next Actions:
   1. Review intake for each package: `.aiwg/intake/*/`
   2. Validate cross-package dependencies (ensure API compatibility)
   3. Run intake-start for each package separately
   ```
9. **Resume Main Flow:** Step 15 (System displays summary)

**Alternate Outcome:**
- 5 separate intake document sets generated (one per package)
- Cross-package dependencies mapped
- User can validate each package independently or as unified project

### Alt-4: Legacy Codebase (No Package Manager, Manual Dependencies)

**Branch Point:** Step 6 (System parses dependency files)
**Condition:** No package manager files found (no package.json, requirements.txt, pom.xml)

**Flow:**
1. System scans for package manager files (Step 6)
2. System finds zero package manager files
3. System detects legacy codebase:
   - Manual dependency management (libraries committed to `vendor/`, `lib/`)
   - No automated dependency updates (high risk for security vulnerabilities)
   - Potentially outdated frameworks (pre-package manager era)
4. System attempts alternative dependency detection:
   - Scan `vendor/` directory for library names (e.g., `vendor/jquery-3.2.1.min.js`)
   - Parse `<script>` tags in HTML files (CDN dependencies)
   - Parse `import` statements in JavaScript files (ES6 modules without package.json)
   - Parse `require()` statements in server-side code (Node.js without package.json)
5. System infers dependencies from file names and import statements:
   - jQuery 3.2.1 (from `vendor/jquery-3.2.1.min.js`)
   - Bootstrap 4.1.0 (from `vendor/bootstrap-4.1.0.css`)
   - Lodash 4.17.5 (from `vendor/lodash.min.js`)
6. System assigns low confidence to dependency analysis (55%):
   - Confidence: Low (55%) - Inferred from file names (version may be outdated or incorrect)
7. System flags dependency management risk:
   - **Risk 1**: No package manager (manual dependency updates, high maintenance burden)
   - **Risk 2**: Outdated dependencies (jQuery 3.2.1 released 2017, 8 years old, potential security vulnerabilities)
   - **Risk 3**: No automated vulnerability scanning (no npm audit, pip-audit)
8. System generates legacy-focused recommendations:
   ```
   ⚠️ Legacy codebase detected (no package manager)

   Dependency Analysis (Low Confidence: 55%):
   - jQuery 3.2.1 (inferred from vendor/jquery-3.2.1.min.js)
   - Bootstrap 4.1.0 (inferred from vendor/bootstrap-4.1.0.css)
   - Lodash 4.17.5 (inferred from vendor/lodash.min.js)

   Risks:
   - No package manager (manual dependency updates)
   - Outdated dependencies (jQuery 3.2.1 from 2017, 8 years old)
   - No automated vulnerability scanning

   Recommendations (High Priority):
   1. Migrate to package manager (npm, yarn, or pnpm)
   2. Create package.json with dependency list
   3. Run vulnerability scan: npm audit or snyk
   4. Update dependencies to latest stable versions
   5. Re-run intake generation after migration
   ```
9. System generates partial intake documents:
   - Technical intake includes "Legacy Dependency Management" section
   - Risk register populated with dependency management risks
   - Confidence score: 55% (low confidence due to manual dependencies)
10. **Resume Main Flow:** Step 15 (System displays summary with legacy warnings)

**Alternate Outcome:**
- Partial intake generated with low-confidence dependency analysis
- User receives clear recommendations for package manager migration
- Dependency risks flagged for immediate remediation

### Alt-5: Microservices Architecture (Multiple Services, Distributed Tracing)

**Branch Point:** Step 5 (System scans codebase structure)
**Condition:** Microservices architecture detected (multiple service directories, Kubernetes manifests)

**Flow:**
1. System scans codebase structure (Step 5)
2. System detects microservices pattern:
   - `services/` directory with multiple service subdirectories (8 services)
   - Each service has own `package.json`, `Dockerfile`, `k8s/` manifests
   - Service mesh configuration detected: Istio (`istio/`), Linkerd, or AWS App Mesh
3. System identifies microservices:
   - `services/auth-service/` (Authentication service, Node.js + JWT)

   - REST APIs: HTTP/HTTPS between services
   - Message queues: RabbitMQ, Kafka (detected from docker-compose.yml)
   - Service discovery: Consul, etcd (detected from config files)
   - Distributed tracing: Jaeger, Zipkin (detected from instrumentation code)
5. System generates service dependency graph:
   - Frontend → API Gateway (HTTP)
   - API Gateway → Auth Service (JWT validation)
   - API Gateway → User Service (user data)
   - API Gateway → Order Service (order management)
   - Order Service → Payment Service (payment processing)
   - Order Service → Notification Service (order confirmations)
   - Analytics Service ← All Services (event streaming)
6. System prompts user for intake scope:
   ```
   Microservices architecture detected (8 services). Generate intake for:
   (A) All services (8 separate intake documents)
   (B) Specific service (select service name)
   (C) System-wide intake (treat as distributed system)
   ```
7. User selects: "C - System-wide intake"
8. System generates system-wide intake:
   - Project intake: Describes distributed system architecture, business goals for all services
   - Technical intake: Lists all 8 services, service dependencies, inter-service communication
   - Stakeholder intake: Lists team structure (microservices teams per service)
9. System includes microservices-specific sections:
   - **Service Registry**: Consul for service discovery
   - **API Gateway**: Express-based gateway with rate limiting
   - **Message Queue**: RabbitMQ for async communication
   - **Distributed Tracing**: Jaeger for observability
   - **Service Mesh**: Istio for traffic management, security, observability
10. System logs microservices analysis:

    - Distributed Tracing: Jaeger

    Next Actions:
    1. Review system-wide intake: `.aiwg/intake/`
    2. Validate service dependencies (ensure API compatibility)
    3. Run intake-start for system-wide validation
    ```
11. **Resume Main Flow:** Step 15 (System displays summary)

**Alternate Outcome:**
- System-wide intake generated for microservices architecture
- Service dependency graph mapped
- Inter-service communication patterns documented

## 10. Exception Flows

### Exc-1: Insufficient Git History (<10 Commits)

**Trigger:** Step 4 (System analyzes git history)
**Condition:** Git repository has <10 commits (insufficient for meaningful inference)

**Flow:**
1. System scans git repository (Step 4)
2. System counts commits: `git rev-list --count HEAD` returns 5 commits
3. System detects insufficient git history (threshold: 10 commits)
4. System displays warning:
   ```
   ⚠️ Insufficient git history (5 commits < 10 threshold)

   Impact: Low confidence for project maturity, team structure, development patterns

   Options:
   (A) Continue with low-confidence intake (best-effort analysis)
   (B) Use manual intake wizard instead (`/project:intake-wizard`)
   (C) Cancel and add more commits before retrying

   Recommendation: Option A if urgent, Option B for higher accuracy
   ```
5. User selects: "A - Continue with low-confidence intake"
6. System proceeds with analysis but assigns low confidence scores (50-60%) to git-inferred fields:
   - Project maturity: Low (50%) - Only 5 commits (early-stage assumption)
   - Team structure: Low (55%) - 2 contributors detected (small team)
   - Development patterns: Low (50%) - Insufficient commit history to infer workflow
7. System flags git-inferred fields with low-confidence warnings:
   - `⚠️ LOW CONFIDENCE (50%): Project Maturity - Only 5 commits detected. Add more commits or validate manually.`
8. System logs warning: "Insufficient git history (5 commits) - proceeding with low-confidence analysis"
9. **Resume Main Flow:** Step 5 (System scans codebase structure)

**Expected Result:** Low-confidence intake generated, user warned of accuracy limitations

### Exc-2: Missing README.md (No Documentation)

**Trigger:** Step 7 (System analyzes README and documentation)
**Condition:** README.md file missing or empty (<100 characters)

**Flow:**
1. System attempts to read README.md (Step 7)
2. File not found error (or file exists but empty)
3. System detects missing documentation
4. System displays warning:
   ```
   ⚠️ README.md missing or empty

   Impact: Low confidence for project description, installation instructions, usage examples

   Fields affected:
   - Project Description: UNKNOWN (no README.md)
   - Installation Instructions: UNKNOWN (no README.md)
   - Usage Examples: UNKNOWN (no README.md)

   Recommendation: Create README.md with project description, installation guide, usage examples
   ```
5. System attempts alternative documentation sources:
   - CHANGELOG.md (extract project description from version 1.0.0 release notes)
   - package.json "description" field (short project description)
   - HTML comment in index.html (sometimes contains project metadata)
6. System generates partial project description from package.json:
   - Example: `"description": "AI Writing Guide - SDLC framework for Claude Code"`
   - Confidence: Low (60%) - Short description, lacks detail
7. System flags documentation-dependent fields as low-confidence:
   - Project description: Low (60%) - Inferred from package.json (lacks detail)
   - Installation instructions: UNKNOWN (0%) - No README.md to extract from
   - Usage examples: UNKNOWN (0%) - No README.md or code samples
8. System prompts user for interactive refinement:
   ```
   Missing README.md detected. Recommend interactive refinement mode:
   `/project:intake-from-codebase . --interactive`

   Interactive mode will ask strategic questions to fill documentation gaps.
   ```
9. User chooses: Continue without interactive mode (accept low confidence)
10. System logs warning: "Missing README.md - documentation-dependent fields flagged as low-confidence"
11. **Resume Main Flow:** Step 8 (System detects infrastructure)

**Expected Result:** Partial intake generated with low-confidence documentation fields

### Exc-3: Git Repository Corrupted (Invalid .git Directory)

**Trigger:** Step 4 (System analyzes git history)
**Condition:** Git repository corrupted (invalid .git directory structure)

**Flow:**
1. System attempts to scan git repository (Step 4)
2. Git command fails: `git rev-list --count HEAD` returns error: "fatal: not a git repository"
3. System detects corrupted git repository
4. System displays error:
   ```
   ❌ Git repository corrupted

   Error: fatal: not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git

   Possible causes:
   - .git directory deleted or corrupted
   - Repository initialized incorrectly
   - File system corruption

   Remediation Steps:
   1. Verify .git directory exists: `ls -la .git`
   2. Re-initialize git repository: `git init` (WARNING: loses history)
   3. Clone from remote: `git clone <repo-url>` (restores history)
   4. Use manual intake wizard: `/project:intake-wizard` (skip git analysis)
   ```
5. User chooses: "4 - Use manual intake wizard"
6. System redirects to manual intake workflow: `/project:intake-wizard`
7. System logs error: "Git repository corrupted - redirecting to manual intake wizard"

   ```
9. **Resume Main Flow:** Step 15 (System displays polyglot summary)

**Expected Result:** Language-specific intake documents generated for Python and JavaScript

### Exc-6: Binary Files Detected (Compiled Code, No Source)

**Trigger:** Step 5 (System scans codebase structure)
**Condition:** Codebase contains only binary files (no source code files)

**Flow:**
1. System scans codebase structure (Step 5)
2. System detects zero source code files (.js, .py, .java, .rb, etc.)
3. System detects binary files: .class (Java bytecode), .pyc (Python bytecode), .dll (compiled libraries)
4. System displays error:
   ```
   ❌ No source code detected (binary files only)

   Files Detected:
   - 142 .class files (Java bytecode)
   - 87 .pyc files (Python bytecode)
   - 23 .dll files (compiled libraries)

   Impact: Cannot analyze codebase without source code

   Possible Causes:
   - Source code not committed to repository (binary-only release)
   - Repository contains only compiled artifacts
   - Wrong directory selected (source code in different location)

   Remediation Steps:
   1. Verify source code exists: Check for .java, .py, .js files
   2. Navigate to source directory: `cd src/` and retry
   3. Clone source repository: Obtain source code from version control
   4. Use manual intake wizard: `/project:intake-wizard` (skip codebase analysis)
   ```
5. User chooses: "2 - Navigate to source directory"
6. User runs: `cd src/ && /project:intake-from-codebase .`
7. System detects source code files in `src/` directory
8. **Resume Main Flow:** Step 5 (System scans codebase structure with source code)

**Expected Result:** Error displayed, user navigates to source directory, retry successful

### Exc-7: Private Repository Access Token Expired (Authentication Failure)

**Trigger:** Step 4 (System analyzes git history)
**Condition:** Git repository requires authentication, access token expired

**Flow:**

2. Git command fails: `git log` returns error: "Authentication failed"
3. System detects authentication failure (access token expired or invalid)
4. System displays error:
   ```
   ❌ Git authentication failed

   Error: Authentication failed for 'https://github.com/username/private-repo.git'

   Possible Causes:
   - Access token expired (GitHub PAT, GitLab token)
   - SSH key invalid or expired
   - Repository is private (requires authentication)

   Remediation Steps:
   1. Regenerate access token: GitHub Settings → Developer Settings → Personal Access Tokens
   2. Update git credentials: `git config --global credential.helper store`
   3. Use SSH instead: Clone with SSH URL (`git@github.com:username/repo.git`)
   4. Retry intake generation after authentication fix
   ```
5. User regenerates GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT)
6. User updates git credentials: `git config --global credential.helper store`
7. User retries: `/project:intake-from-codebase .`
8. System successfully reads git history with new credentials
9. **Resume Main Flow:** Step 4 (System analyzes git history)

**Expected Result:** Authentication error resolved, git analysis successful on retry

## 12. Related Business Rules

**BR-IC-001: Confidence Scoring Thresholds**
- **High confidence (90%+)**: Git history rich (100+ commits), README detailed (1,000+ words), standard project structure
- **Medium confidence (70-89%)**: Some documentation missing, non-standard structure, sparse git history (10-99 commits)
- **Low confidence (<70%)**: Minimal documentation (<100 words), sparse history (<10 commits), unusual structure

**BR-IC-002: Interactive Refinement Triggers**
- Automatically triggered if overall confidence <70%
- User can manually trigger with `--interactive` flag
- Maximum 5 strategic questions per refinement session

**BR-IC-003: Shallow Analysis Mode Thresholds**
- Enabled automatically for codebases >10GB
- User can manually enable with `--shallow` flag
- Skips full codebase scan (README + package.json only)

**BR-IC-004: Polyglot Language Detection**
- Polyglot if no single language >60% of files
- Primary language = language with highest file count
- Generate separate intake per language if polyglot

**BR-IC-005: Monorepo Package Detection**
- Monorepo if `packages/` directory exists with 2+ subdirectories
- Each package analyzed separately (unless user selects unified intake)
- Cross-package dependencies mapped in system-wide intake

**BR-IC-006: Git History Minimum Threshold**
- Minimum 10 commits required for meaningful analysis
- <10 commits triggers low-confidence warning
- User can proceed with low-confidence intake or use manual wizard

**BR-IC-007: Binary File Exclusion**
- Binary files excluded from analysis (.class, .pyc, .dll, .exe)
- Source code files required (.js, .py, .java, .rb, etc.)
- Error if zero source files detected
