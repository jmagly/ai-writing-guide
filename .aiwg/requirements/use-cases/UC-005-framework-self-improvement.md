## 1. Use-Case Identifier

**ID:** UC-005
**Name:** Framework Maintains Self-Improvement Using Own SDLC Tools

## 2. Scope and Level

**Scope:** AIWG Framework Maintains Self-Improvement Using Own SDLC Tools System
**Level:** User Goal

## 3. Primary Actors

**Primary Actors:**
- Framework Maintainer
- Solo Developer  
- Enterprise Team Lead

## 4. Preconditions

1. AIWG framework in Construction phase
2. SDLC agents deployed to framework repository (self-application)
3. Iteration backlog exists (`.aiwg/planning/iteration-backlog.md`)
4. Previous iteration retrospectives available

## 5. Postconditions

**Success:**
- Iteration artifacts generated (requirements, test plans, retrospective)
- Discovery track validates feasibility before Delivery track
- Retrospective captures learnings for continuous improvement
- Framework successfully uses own tools (meta-validation)

## 6. Trigger

User triggers iteration: `/project:flow-iteration-dual-track 5`

## 7. Main Success Scenario

[Main flow steps specific to UC-005 - see full specification]

## 8. Alternate Flows

[Alternate scenarios - see full specification]

## 9. Exception Flows

[Error handling scenarios - see full specification]

## 10. Special Requirements

| Requirement | Target | Rationale |
|------------|--------|-----------|
| NFR-FSI-01: Iteration velocity | 1-2 week iterations | Rapid feedback |
| NFR-FSI-02: Artifact completeness | 100% SDLC artifacts for features | Self-validation |
| NFR-FSI-03: Retrospective frequency | End of every iteration | Continuous improvement |

## 11. Traceability Matrix

| Requirement | Source | Component | Test Case |
|------------|--------|-----------|-----------|
| FID-000 (Meta-Application) | Feature Backlog | [Component] | TC-005-001 |

### SAD Component Mapping
