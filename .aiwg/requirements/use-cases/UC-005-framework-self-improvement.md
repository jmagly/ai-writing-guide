5. Iteration Planner generates iteration plan:
   - **Discovery Track (Week 1)**: Spike on rollback strategies, prototype plugin sandbox
   - **Delivery Track (Week 2)**: Implement InstallationTransaction class, build security validators
   - **Test Strategy**: Unit tests for rollback logic, security attack simulations
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: 15 criteria (5 per feature)
   - Saves to: `.aiwg/planning/iteration-5-plan.md` (1,800 words)
6. Orchestrator confirms plan: "Iteration 5 plan generated (1,800 words). Discovery track: 2 spikes. Delivery track: 2 features."

   - Estimates delay: +1 week to redesign architecture
   - Recommends: Pivot to snapshot-based rollback (ADR-006 revision)
4. Orchestrator prompts Framework Maintainer: "Discovery track blocked. Recommend pivot to snapshot-based rollback (+1 week). Approve pivot?"
5. Maintainer approves: "Yes, revise ADR-006 and extend iteration to 3 weeks."
6. Orchestrator updates iteration plan:
   - Extends timeline: Oct 18 - Nov 8 (3 weeks)
   - Revises Discovery track: Additional spike on snapshot-based rollback
7. Orchestrator relaunches Research Coordinator with new spike requirements

3. Orchestrator analyzes failures:
   - Root cause: Incomplete file restoration in edge case (nested directories)
   - Impact: High (data loss risk)
   - Severity: Blocker (cannot release)
4. Orchestrator launches Code Reviewer agent:
   - Reads failing test logs
   - Identifies bug: Missing recursive directory restoration
   - Implements fix: Add recursive directory walk to rollback logic
   - Re-runs tests: 25/25 passing
5. Orchestrator confirms fix: "Bug resolved. All 25 tests passing. Coverage: 92%."
