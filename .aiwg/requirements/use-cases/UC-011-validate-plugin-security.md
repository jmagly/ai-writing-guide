2. Security validators implemented (PathValidator, InjectionValidator, DependencyVerifier)
3. Forbidden path blacklist configured
4. User approval workflow enabled

## 5. Postconditions

**Success:**
- Plugin security validated (path traversal, YAML bombs, injection attacks)
- Dangerous content blocked before installation
- User approval obtained for sensitive operations
- Security score calculated (0-100)
- Dependency integrity verified (SHA-256 hashes)
- Plugin installed safely or rejected with clear reasons

## 6. Trigger
