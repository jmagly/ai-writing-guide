     - Team capacity utilization: 95% (optimal, low burnout risk)
8. **Metrics Analyst Generates Recommendations** (Phase 5: Actionable Insights):
   - **Process Improvement Recommendations**:
     - **Recommendation 1**: Increase deployment frequency from 1.33/week to 3/week (target: DORA High rating)
       - Rationale: Lead time is acceptable (4.8 days), but deployment batching introduces risk
       - Action: Implement continuous deployment pipeline (automate release workflow)
       - Impact: Reduce change failure rate from 8.3% to <5% (smaller, safer deployments)
     - **Recommendation 2**: Maintain current velocity (36.6 SP/iteration) - do not increase scope
       - Rationale: Quality improving faster than velocity (sustainable pace validated)
       - Action: Continue dual-track iteration pattern (Discovery + Delivery)
       - Impact: Preserve quality gains, avoid burnout, maintain 92% test coverage
     - **Recommendation 3**: Automate retrospective action item tracking
       - Rationale: 3-5 action items per retrospective, unclear completion rate
       - Action: Create FID-008 (Action Item Tracker) for iteration 6
       - Impact: Close continuous improvement loop (validate action items drive velocity improvements)
   - **Risk Mitigation Recommendations**:
     - **Risk**: Velocity may plateau as framework matures (complexity increases)
       - Likelihood: Medium (common pattern in maturing projects)
       - Mitigation: Prioritize technical debt reduction (20% capacity per iteration)
       - Monitoring: Track velocity slope (alert if velocity drops >10% over 3 iterations)
     - **Risk**: Quality maintenance cost may increase (test suite growth)
       - Likelihood: Low (test coverage already high at 92%)
       - Mitigation: Implement test execution optimization (parallel test runs)
       - Monitoring: Track test execution time (alert if exceeds 10 minutes)
   - Saves recommendations to: `.aiwg/working/metrics-collection/recommendations.md`
9. **Metrics Analyst Generates Dashboard** (Phase 6: Visualization):
   - Creates comprehensive metrics dashboard: `.aiwg/reports/metrics-dashboard.md`
   - Dashboard includes:

     - **Velocity Trends**: Line charts (commits/day, PRs/week, story points/iteration)
     - **Quality Trends**: Stacked bar charts (test coverage, code review approval rate)
     - **DORA Metrics**: Quadrant chart (deployment frequency, lead time, MTTR, change failure rate)
     - **Capacity Planning**: Burndown chart (quarterly forecast, iteration velocity projection)
     - **Recommendations**: Bulleted action items (process improvements, risk mitigation)
   - Dashboard format: Markdown with embedded mermaid.js charts (GitHub-compatible)
   - Dashboard word count: 2,800 words (comprehensive yet scannable)
10. **Metrics Analyst Updates Historical Data** (Phase 7: Data Persistence):
    - Appends current metrics to historical CSV files:
      - `.aiwg/metrics/velocity-history.csv` (90-day rolling window)
      - `.aiwg/metrics/quality-history.csv` (all-time quality scores)
      - `.aiwg/metrics/dora-history.csv` (quarterly DORA snapshots)
    - Archives raw metrics data: `.aiwg/working/metrics-collection/raw-data-2025-10-22.json`
    - Applies data retention policy: Deletes CSV rows older than 12 months (NFR-DATA-003)
    - Maintains audit trail: Permanent retention in `.aiwg/metrics/audit-trail.log`
11. **Core Orchestrator Reports Metrics Summary**:
    - Orchestrator confirms metrics collection success
    - Reports execution time: 45 seconds (well under 90-second target for NFR-PERF-005)
    - Displays high-level summary:
      - "Velocity: +18% (improving) | Quality: 91/100 (+12 pts) | DORA: Medium (2/4 Elite)"
      - "Deployment frequency: 1.33/week | Lead time: 4.8 days | MTTR: 1.2 hours | CFR: 8.3%"
      - "Recommendations: 3 process improvements, 2 risk mitigations"
    - Provides dashboard link: "Full dashboard: .aiwg/reports/metrics-dashboard.md"
12. **Framework Maintainer Reviews Dashboard**:
    - Opens dashboard file: `.aiwg/reports/metrics-dashboard.md`
    - Reviews velocity trends: "Velocity improving consistently (+18% over 5 iterations)"
    - Reviews quality trends: "Test coverage 92%, defect escape rate 2.1% (excellent)"
    - Reviews DORA metrics: "MTTR elite (1.2 hours), deployment frequency needs improvement"
    - Reviews recommendations: "Increase deployment frequency to 3/week - actionable"
13. **Maintainer Validates "Quality Without Friction" Claim**:
    - Compares velocity trend (+18%) vs quality trend (+20 percentage points)
    - **Conclusion**: Quality improving faster than velocity - framework delivers on promise
    - Quantitative proof: Framework maintains high quality (91/100) while increasing velocity
    - Validates vision-document.md success metrics (lines 136-167): "Ship weekly, test comprehensively, maintain 80%+ coverage"
14. **Maintainer Creates Action Items from Recommendations**:
    - Creates FID-008 (Action Item Tracker) for iteration 6 backlog
    - Creates FID-009 (Continuous Deployment Pipeline) for v1.1 roadmap

   - Task 2: Quality metrics (test coverage, code review)
   - Task 3: DORA metrics (deployment frequency, lead time)
5. Orchestrator launches 3 parallel Metrics Analyst instances (Task tool)
6. Parallel execution completes in 2.5 minutes (50% time reduction)
7. Orchestrator merges parallel results into unified dashboard
8. **Resume Main Flow:** Step 9 (Metrics Analyst generates dashboard from merged parallel data)

### Exc-5: Artifact Parse Error (Corrupted Iteration Plan JSON)

**Trigger:** Step 4 (Metrics Analyst collects velocity metrics - story point extraction)
**Condition:** Iteration plan file corrupted (invalid JSON frontmatter)

**Flow:**
1. Metrics Analyst attempts to parse iteration plan: `.aiwg/planning/iteration-5-plan.md`
2. JSON frontmatter parse error: "Unexpected token in JSON at position 245"
3. Analyst detects corrupted artifact
4. Analyst logs parse error: `.aiwg/working/metrics-collection/parse-errors.log`
   - "Parse Error: .aiwg/planning/iteration-5-plan.md (invalid JSON frontmatter)"
5. Analyst falls back to regex extraction:
   - Searches iteration plan for story point pattern: `story_points: (\d+)`
   - Regex match found: `story_points: 38`
   - Extracts story points via fallback method (38 story points)
6. Analyst logs fallback success: "Fallback extraction succeeded for iteration-5-plan.md"
7. Analyst includes data quality note in dashboard:
   - "Data Quality Note: Iteration 5 story points extracted via fallback (regex). Verify accuracy manually."
8. **Resume Main Flow:** Step 5 (Metrics Analyst collects quality metrics with fallback data)

### Exc-6: Insufficient Data for Trend Calculation (<3 Data Points)

**Trigger:** Step 7 (Metrics Analyst identifies trends and anomalies)
**Condition:** Only 2 iterations completed (cannot calculate 3-point moving average)

**Flow:**
1. Metrics Analyst attempts to calculate velocity trend
2. Iteration count check: 2 iterations (below 3-iteration minimum for trend analysis)
3. Analyst detects insufficient data for statistical trend calculation
4. Analyst generates snapshot comparison instead of trend:
   - Iteration 1: 32 story points
   - Iteration 2: 35 story points
   - Change: +3 story points (+9.4%)
   - Trend: Cannot calculate (need 3+ iterations for trend line)
5. Analyst includes data limitation disclaimer in dashboard:
   - "Trend Analysis: Insufficient data (2 iterations). Trend calculation requires 3+ iterations."
   - "Current Snapshot: +9.4% velocity improvement (Iteration 1 â†’ Iteration 2)"
6. Analyst recommends action: "Re-run metrics collection after iteration 3 completion for trend analysis."
7. **Resume Main Flow:** Step 8 (Metrics Analyst generates recommendations based on snapshot data)

## 14. Open Issues and TODOs

1. **Issue 001: Cross-Project Metrics Aggregation Dependency**
   - **Description**: Multi-project metrics aggregation (Alt-4) requires FID-007 (Workspace Management) which is deferred to P2
   - **Impact**: Solo developers managing multiple AIWG projects cannot aggregate metrics across projects
   - **Workaround**: Manually run `/project:project-metrics` per project and manually aggregate results
   - **Owner**: Metrics Analyst agent
   - **Due Date**: Version 2.0 (post-MVP, after FID-007 delivery)

2. **Issue 002: DORA Metrics Industry Benchmark Accuracy**
   - **Description**: DORA metric thresholds (Elite/High/Medium/Low) based on 2023 industry benchmarks - may be outdated
   - **Impact**: DORA rating may not reflect current industry standards
   - **Mitigation**: Review DORA benchmarks annually, update thresholds as industry evolves
   - **Owner**: Product Strategist
   - **Due Date**: Q1 2026 (annual benchmark review)

3. **TODO 001: Live Dashboard Visual Charts**
   - **Description**: Live dashboard currently uses Markdown + mermaid.js (text-based charts) - consider HTML dashboard with Chart.js for richer visualizations
   - **Benefit**: Improved UX (interactive charts, drill-down capabilities)
   - **Assigned**: Dashboard Designer agent
   - **Due Date**: Version 1.2 (post-MVP enhancement)

4. **TODO 002: Automated Anomaly Root Cause Analysis**
   - **Description**: Current anomaly detection flags velocity drops/quality regressions but requires manual root cause analysis
   - **Enhancement**: Integrate LLM-based root cause analysis (e.g., Claude analyzes Git commits + retrospectives to identify root causes)
   - **Benefit**: Faster remediation (automated diagnosis reduces investigation time)
   - **Assigned**: Metrics Analyst agent
   - **Due Date**: Version 1.3

5. **TODO 003: Metrics Collection Performance Optimization**
   - **Description**: Large projects (>10,000 commits) may exceed 2-minute target for NFR-MT-01 - investigate parallel Git log parsing
   - **Enhancement**: Implement chunked Git log parsing with parallel execution (similar to Exc-4)
   - **Benefit**: Scale to enterprise-sized repositories (100k+ commits)
   - **Assigned**: Performance Engineer agent
