## Identifier

- ID: UC-001
- Name: Validate AI-Generated Content for Authenticity

## Summary

Content creators using AI chat interfaces need to remove formulaic patterns from AI-generated writing to avoid detection tools while maintaining professional sophistication. The writing-validator agent analyzes content against banned pattern lists and provides specific rewrite suggestions, enabling iterative improvement until content achieves authentic human voice (AI detection score 4-5 on Likert scale).

## Actors & Preconditions

- Primary actor(s): Content creator, technical writer, blog author, documentation specialist
- Preconditions:
  - Content draft exists (generated via Claude, ChatGPT, or other LLM)
  - writing-validator agent deployed to project (.claude/agents/writing-validator.md)
  - Validation documents accessible (banned-patterns.md, sophistication-guide.md)

## Main Success Scenario

1. User generates initial content draft via AI chat interface (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.)
2. User invokes writing-validator agent: `/project:writing-validator "path/to/content.md"`
3. Agent analyzes content against banned patterns database (formulaic phrases, hedging language, excessive qualifiers)
4. Agent returns detailed feedback report:
   - Flagged patterns with line numbers and specific text
   - Rewrite suggestions maintaining sophistication level
   - Authenticity score (1-5 Likert scale: AI-detected → Human-authentic)
5. User iterates on content based on feedback, removing flagged patterns
6. User re-validates content until authenticity score reaches 4-5 (Often/Always passes AI detection)
7. User publishes content with confidence in authentic voice
8. (Optional) User shares before/after examples to framework community for pattern database improvement

## Postconditions

- Content authenticity score improved from 2-3 (AI-detected) to 4-5 (Human-authentic)
- Flagged AI patterns removed while preserving technical depth and sophistication
- User gains pattern recognition skills for future content generation
- (Optional) Community benefits from shared examples improving validation database

## Success Criteria (Quantifiable)

- AI detection score improves from 2-3 → 4-5 (Likert scale: Never/Rarely/Sometimes/Often/Always passes detection)
- 90%+ of flagged patterns successfully rewritten in <3 iterations
- User-reported satisfaction: "Content feels more authentic and credible" (4+ on 5-point scale)
- Validation completes in <60 seconds for 2000-word documents
- Zero false positives (legitimate sophisticated language flagged as AI patterns) reported by users

## Priority

**HIGH** - Core functionality for Writing Quality Framework, primary use case for AI Users persona

## Effort Estimate

**User Effort**: 30-60 minutes per 2000-word document (1st iteration), 15-30 minutes (subsequent iterations as pattern recognition improves)

**Agent Processing**: <60 seconds per validation run

**Learning Curve**: 1-2 validation cycles to understand pattern recognition, 5-10 cycles to internalize authentic voice principles

## Notes

**Open Questions**:
- Should validation support multiple content types (blog post vs academic paper vs technical documentation) with different pattern thresholds?
- How to handle domain-specific jargon that may resemble AI patterns but is required for technical accuracy?

**Risks**:
- Over-correction: Users may remove legitimate sophisticated vocabulary in pursuit of authenticity
- Subjectivity: "Authentic" varies by domain, audience, and content type (requires calibrated validation rules)

**Dependencies**:
- Banned patterns database (validation/banned-patterns.md) must be comprehensive and current
- Sophistication guide (core/sophistication-guide.md) must provide domain-specific guidance
- Agent must access full context (templates, examples) without context window truncation

**Future Enhancements**:
- Domain-specific validation profiles (academic, technical, marketing, creative)
- Integration with AI detection tools (GPTZero, Originality.ai) for validation scoring
- Before/after example gallery for learning pattern recognition
