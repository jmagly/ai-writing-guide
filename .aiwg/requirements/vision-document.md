# AI Writing Guide (AIWG) Vision Document

**Document Version:** v1.0 (BASELINED)
**Created:** 2025-10-17
**Author:** Vision Owner with Multi-Agent Synthesis
**Status:** BASELINED - Ready for Implementation

> **Note:** See Appendix E: Glossary for term definitions.

## Executive Summary

The AI Writing Guide (AIWG) is a comprehensive SDLC framework designed to bring structure, traceability, and quality to agentic software development. Our vision extends beyond creating tools for others - AIWG must prove its value by successfully applying its own framework to develop itself.

**Strategic Direction:** The contributor workflow feature serves as both a critical capability AND the demonstration vehicle for AIWG's self-application maturity. By building this feature using our complete SDLC process - from intake through production deployment - we establish credible proof that AIWG can manage real-world development at scale.

**MVP Definition:** Complete traceable artifacts (intake → architecture → testing → deployment) for contributor workflow, demonstrating full SDLC cycle on a production feature.

## Problem Statement

### The Core Challenge

Agentic development environments (Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, etc.) excel at rapid feature generation but lack structured lifecycle management. This creates three critical problems:

1. **Process Gap:** Projects move from concept to code with no requirements, architecture, or test artifacts between chat logs and commits
2. **Quality Gap:** Fast iteration without gates leads to technical debt, security vulnerabilities, and unmaintainable code
3. **Traceability Gap:** Decisions buried in chat history, making audit trails impossible and knowledge transfer difficult

### Why Self-Application Matters

AIWG faces a credibility challenge: recommending comprehensive SDLC processes while our own development lacks formal artifacts beyond README files and ad-hoc commits. This creates:

- **Trust Deficit:** Users question framework value when we don't visibly use it ourselves
- **Validation Risk:** Without dogfooding, we can't identify real-world friction points
- **Maturity Concerns:** Frameworks that can't manage their own evolution appear immature

**Critical Insight:** The fastest path to proving AIWG's value is building a feature we need (contributor workflow) using the complete AIWG process. Success creates a reference implementation that others can study and replicate.

## Vision Statement

**AIWG becomes the standard SDLC framework for agentic development by demonstrating that sophisticated processes enhance (not hinder) rapid iteration.**

We achieve this through:

1. **Self-Application First:** Every AIWG feature developed using full SDLC artifacts (intake, requirements, architecture, testing, deployment)
2. **Traceable Development:** Complete audit trail from initial concept through production deployment
3. **Quality Without Friction:** Processes that improve code quality while maintaining ship velocity
4. **Reference Implementation:** Contributor workflow as the exemplar for "how to use AIWG on real projects"

## Strategic Objectives

### Primary Objective: Demonstrate Self-Application Capability

**Goal:** Complete contributor workflow feature with full SDLC artifacts visible in `.aiwg/` directory.

**Success Criteria:**
- Intake forms documenting feature requirements and constraints
- Software Architecture Document (SAD) describing system design
- Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) justifying key choices
- Test strategy and validation results
- Deployment plan and runbooks
- Complete traceability from requirements to code to tests

**Why This Matters:** When users inspect AIWG's repository, they see a working example of the framework applied to itself. This "show, don't tell" approach builds credibility faster than any documentation.

### Secondary Objective: Enable Community Growth

**Goal:** Reduce contribution friction through automated workflows and quality gates.

**Success Criteria:**
- Contributors can fork, develop, test, and PR using only AIWG commands
- Quality gates catch 90%+ of maintainability issues automatically
- PR review time reduced by 50% through automated validation
- 80%+ PR merge rate (indicating clear quality standards)

**Why This Matters:** Self-application proves AIWG works on itself. Community contributions prove it works for others. Together, they establish market validation.

### Tertiary Objective: Establish Reference Architecture

**Goal:** Contributor workflow becomes the template for all future AIWG feature development.

**Success Criteria:**
- Architecture patterns documented in ADRs
- Reusable components identified and extracted
- Development process documented for future features
- Lessons learned captured in retrospectives

**Why This Matters:** First feature developed with full SDLC establishes precedents. Make them right, and future development accelerates. Get them wrong, and technical debt compounds.

## Key Assumptions

### Critical Assumptions (High Risk if Wrong)

**Assumption 1: Self-application drives adoption**
- **Rationale:** Developers trust frameworks that use their own processes
- **Validation:** Track user feedback, measure adoption after contributor workflow launch
- **Risk if Wrong:** Self-application effort wasted if users don't value credibility
- **Mitigation:** User interviews pre-launch to validate assumption

**Assumption 2: Full SDLC doesn't slow velocity**
- **Rationale:** AIWG processes designed for efficiency (agent-assisted artifact generation)
- **Validation:** Measure contributor workflow development time vs previous features
- **Risk if Wrong:** Process overhead kills momentum, users reject complexity
- **Mitigation:** Optimize workflows based on dogfooding friction points

**Assumption 3: Community contributions provide market validation**
- **Rationale:** Active contributions signal product-market fit
- **Validation:** Track contribution volume, quality, and contributor retention
- **Risk if Wrong:** No contributors = no market, solo maintainer burnout
- **Mitigation:** Start with 2-5 user testing, validate before scaling

### Supporting Assumptions (Lower Risk)

**Assumption 4: Platform integrations drive growth**
- **Rationale:** Supporting multiple platforms (Claude, Cursor, Windsurf) expands addressable market
- **Validation:** Track which platforms contributors target
- **Risk if Wrong:** Fragmentation across platforms dilutes focus
- **Mitigation:** Start with Claude Code (primary), expand based on demand

**Assumption 5: Automated quality gates improve PR quality**
- **Rationale:** Instant feedback helps contributors meet standards before submission
- **Validation:** Compare PR quality scores before/after gate implementation
- **Risk if Wrong:** Gates too strict (block valid PRs) or too loose (miss issues)
- **Mitigation:** Tune thresholds based on actual PR outcomes (start at 80%, adjust)

**Assumption 6: Documentation completeness matters for enterprise**
- **Rationale:** Regulated industries require audit trails and traceability
- **Validation:** Enterprise user feedback on artifact completeness
- **Risk if Wrong:** Overhead not valued by target users
- **Mitigation:** Modular framework (users choose rigor level for their context)

## Outstanding Questions

### Strategic Questions

**Q1: What is the optimal self-application rigor level?**
- **Context:** AIWG supports minimal to enterprise rigor. Which level for our own development?
- **Options:**
  - A) Minimal (intake + ADRs only) - fastest, least overhead
  - B) Moderate (add architecture + test plan) - balanced
  - C) Full (complete Inception → Transition artifacts) - maximum credibility
- **Decision Needed By:** Before Phase 1 implementation start
- **Owner:** Vision Owner + Requirements Analyst
- **Current Thinking:** Start with (C) Full for contributor workflow to prove capability, then evaluate if sustainable

**Q2: Community vs Commercial vs Personal Tool - which path?**
- **Context:** Undecided long-term strategy (depends on traction)
- **Options:**
  - A) Community-driven (open source, volunteer maintainers)
  - B) Commercial SaaS (paid features, support SLAs)
  - C) Personal tool (low maintenance, no support)
- **Decision Needed By:** After 6 months user feedback
- **Owner:** Project Owner (Joseph Magly)
- **Current Thinking:** Stay open source, pivot based on enterprise vs community traction

**Q3: How many platforms should AIWG support?**
- **Context:** Currently Claude Code focused, OpenAI/Cursor/Windsurf interest exists. AIWG deployment infrastructure already supports multi-platform (deploy-agents.mjs has --provider flag for Claude/OpenAI).
- **Options:**
  - A) Single platform (Claude Code only) - simpler maintenance
  - B) Multi-platform abstraction (unified API, platform adapters) - broader reach
  - C) Platform-specific versions (separate distributions) - optimized UX per platform
- **Decision Needed By:** After contributor workflow proves single-platform viability
- **Owner:** Architecture Designer + DevOps Lead
- **Current Thinking:** Deployment infrastructure already multi-platform capable. Contributor workflow Claude-only for MVP, expand based on demand.

### Tactical Questions

**Q4: Should contributors work in AIWG install directory or separate clone?**
- **Context:** Security vs convenience trade-off
- **Options:**
  - A) Direct in `~/.local/share/ai-writing-guide` (easy testing, quick abort)
  - B) Separate clone (cleaner separation, slower testing)
- **Decision Status:** APPROVED - Option A (direct install work, abort with `aiwg -reinstall`)
- **Rationale:** Easy testing, can abort with full reinstall if needed

**Q5: What quality score threshold for PR acceptance?**
- **Context:** Balance between accessibility and maintainability
- **Options:**
  - A) 70/100 (accessible, more review burden)
  - B) 80/100 (balanced)
  - C) 90/100 (high quality, may discourage contributions)
- **Decision Status:** APPROVED - 80-90/100 range (can help fill gap, but PRs may still need changes)
- **Rationale:** Automated gates catch most issues, maintainer review for nuanced decisions

**Q6: How to handle multi-platform SDLC artifact generation?**
- **Context:** Claude Code uses `.claude/agents/`, OpenAI might use `.codex/agents/` or single `AGENTS.md`
- **Options:**
  - A) Platform-specific SDLC artifacts (duplicate templates per platform)
  - B) Unified artifacts with platform detection (single source, generated outputs)
  - C) Manual platform selection (user chooses format)
- **Decision Needed By:** If/when multi-platform pivot happens
- **Owner:** Architecture Designer
- **Current Thinking:** Defer until multi-platform demand validates need

## Risks and Mitigation

### Critical Risks (High Impact, High Priority)

**Risk 1: Process Overhead Kills Velocity**
- **Description:** Full SDLC artifacts slow development, contributors abandon complex workflows
- **Impact:** High (undermines value proposition - AIWG should enhance not hinder velocity)
- **Likelihood:** Medium (mitigated by agent-assisted generation, but unproven at scale)
- **Mitigation:**
  - **Pre-emptive:** Design for efficiency (reusable templates, automated generation)
  - **Detective:** Measure time-to-PR vs previous features, track contributor friction
  - **Corrective:** Simplify workflows if data shows excessive overhead
- **Owner:** Process Lead
- **Status:** Active - monitoring contributor workflow development time

**Risk 2: Self-Application Reveals Framework Flaws**
- **Description:** Dogfooding exposes gaps, inefficiencies, or broken workflows in AIWG
- **Impact:** High (framework credibility damaged if self-application fails publicly)
- **Likelihood:** Medium (early/experimental self-application stage, expect issues)
- **Mitigation:**
  - **Pre-emptive:** Accept imperfection, document learnings transparently
  - **Detective:** Capture friction points in retrospectives, track workarounds
  - **Corrective:** Treat flaws as validation opportunities, fix and republish
- **Owner:** Quality Lead + Vision Owner
- **Status:** Active - embracing "show our work" philosophy

**Risk 3: Solo Maintainer Burnout**
- **Description:** Comprehensive SDLC + community contributions overwhelm single developer
- **Impact:** High (project abandonment risk if maintainer capacity exceeded)
- **Likelihood:** Medium (current velocity 1+ commit/day, adding PR review burden)
- **Mitigation:**
  - **Pre-emptive:** Automate quality gates, design for self-service contribution
  - **Detective:** Monitor maintainer time allocation, watch for review backlog
  - **Corrective:** Recruit 2nd maintainer within 6 months, establish support boundaries
- **Owner:** Project Owner (Joseph Magly)
- **Status:** Planned - maintainer tools designed to reduce review burden 50%

### High Impact, Medium Priority Risks

**Risk 4: No Community Contributions Materialize**
- **Description:** Contributors don't adopt AIWG workflows despite tooling investment
- **Impact:** High (invalidates community growth strategy, wastes development effort)
- **Likelihood:** Low (early user testing should validate before full investment)
- **Mitigation:**
  - **Pre-emptive:** User testing with 2-5 contributors before Phase 2
  - **Detective:** Track contribution volume, contributor satisfaction scores
  - **Corrective:** Pivot to personal tool or commercial support if community doesn't form
- **Owner:** Community Lead
- **Status:** Validation in progress - user testing underway

**Risk 5: Multi-Platform Fragmentation**
- **Description:** Supporting multiple platforms (Claude, OpenAI, Cursor) creates maintenance burden
- **Impact:** Medium (increases complexity, but broader reach if managed well)
- **Likelihood:** Medium (platform vendors evolve independently, APIs diverge)
- **Mitigation:**
  - **Pre-emptive:** Defer multi-platform contributor workflow until single-platform proves viable. Note: Deployment infrastructure already supports multi-platform abstraction.
  - **Detective:** Track platform-specific feature requests
  - **Corrective:** Leverage existing abstraction layer in deployment tools if multi-platform demand validates
- **Owner:** Architecture Designer
- **Status:** Deferred - Claude Code focus for contributor workflow MVP, infrastructure ready for expansion

### Medium Impact, Lower Priority Risks

**Risk 6: Enterprise Adoption Requires Compliance Features**
- **Description:** Enterprise users need SOC2, HIPAA, ISO27001 templates not yet built
- **Impact:** Medium (limits enterprise market, but not blocking for community/SMB)
- **Likelihood:** Medium (enterprise SRE background suggests eventual enterprise usage)
- **Mitigation:**
  - **Pre-emptive:** Design modular framework (enterprise templates addable later)
  - **Detective:** Track enterprise user requests for compliance features
  - **Corrective:** Add enterprise templates if demand validates (6-12 month timeline)
- **Owner:** Compliance Specialist (future role)
- **Status:** Deferred - focus on core framework first

## Alignment with Strategic Inputs

### Integration with Product Strategy

**Product Strategist Input:** "Two products in one repository - writing quality framework + SDLC toolkit. Focus SDLC toolkit as critical path."

**Vision Alignment:**
- Contributor workflow focuses on SDLC toolkit (not writing guide)
- Self-application proves SDLC framework works on real projects
- Writing guide can iterate slower while SDLC matures through dogfooding

**Product Strategist Input:** "Modular deployment - users compose subset based on project type (smallest to largest apps)."

**Vision Alignment:**
- Contributor workflow demonstrates modular usage (lightweight intake + plan, not full enterprise rigor)
- Establishes pattern for "what subset to use when" guidance
- Proves framework scales from personal scripts to enterprise systems

### Integration with Business Process Analysis

**Business Process Analyst Input:** "Self-improvement loops critical - tooling builds/manages itself, superior documentation vs chat logs."

**Vision Alignment:**
- Contributor workflow IS a self-improvement loop (using AIWG to improve AIWG)
- Generated artifacts (intake, SAD, test plans) replace hard-to-process chat logs
- Automated PR acceptance patterns emerging from contributor workflow

**Business Process Analyst Input:** "Support capacity limiting factor - can't support 100 issues/week solo."

**Vision Alignment:**
- Maintainer tools designed to reduce review burden 50%
- Quality gates automate 90%+ of validation (less manual review)
- Self-service contribution workflow reduces onboarding overhead

### Integration with Stakeholder Feedback

**Solo Developer (Joseph Magly):** "Ship-now mindset - already usable, iterate based on feedback. Accepting technical debt short-term."

**Vision Alignment:**
- Phase 1 focuses on MVP (4 weeks to functional contributor workflow)
- Full SDLC artifacts ensure quality without blocking velocity
- Retrospectives identify technical debt, plan paydown incrementally

**Enterprise SRE/Eng Background:** "Plan to use for enterprise work eventually, need compliance and audit trails."

**Vision Alignment:**
- Self-application establishes audit trail precedent
- Contributor workflow artifacts demonstrate compliance-ready documentation
- Enterprise templates deferred until validation, but architecture supports future addition

**Community Contributors (Future):** "Need clear contribution path, automated quality feedback, responsive maintainers."

**Vision Alignment:**
- Contributor commands provide guided workflow (fork → develop → test → PR)
- Quality gates give instant feedback (no waiting for maintainer review)
- Maintainer tools ensure <3 day PR cycle time

## Decision Log

### Strategic Decisions

**Decision 1: Use Contributor Workflow as Self-Application Proof**
- **Date:** 2025-10-17
- **Context:** Need credible demonstration of AIWG self-application capability
- **Decision:** Develop contributor workflow using full SDLC process (intake → deployment)
- **Rationale:** Feature serves dual purpose - critical functionality + reference implementation
- **Owner:** Vision Owner + Project Owner
- **Status:** APPROVED

**Decision 2: Full SDLC Rigor for Phase 1**
- **Date:** 2025-10-17
- **Context:** What rigor level to apply? Minimal, Moderate, or Full?
- **Decision:** Full SDLC (Inception → Elaboration → Construction → Transition artifacts)
- **Rationale:** Maximum credibility demonstration, establishes patterns for future features
- **Trade-offs:** Higher overhead (acceptable for first full run), longer timeline (4 weeks vs 2)
- **Owner:** Vision Owner + Requirements Analyst
- **Status:** APPROVED

**Decision 3: Defer Multi-Platform Contributor Workflow Until Validation**
- **Date:** 2025-10-17
- **Context:** AIWG deployment infrastructure already supports multi-platform (deploy-agents.mjs has --provider flag for Claude/OpenAI). Question: Should contributor workflow support all platforms from Phase 1?
- **Decision:** Contributor workflow Claude Code-only for Phase 1-2, multi-platform expansion based on contributor demand
- **Rationale:** Prove single-platform viability before adding platform-specific testing complexity. Deployment abstraction already exists (low migration cost if demand validates).
- **Trade-offs:** Smaller addressable market for contributors initially (Claude Code users only), but faster Phase 1 execution
- **Owner:** Architecture Designer + Product Strategist
- **Status:** APPROVED

### Tactical Decisions

**Decision 4: Contributors Work in AIWG Install Directory**
- **Date:** 2025-10-17
- **Context:** Where should contributors develop? Install directory or separate clone?
- **Decision:** Direct work in `~/.local/share/ai-writing-guide`, abort with `aiwg -reinstall`
- **Rationale:** Easy testing, quick recovery if issues
- **Owner:** DevOps Lead
- **Status:** APPROVED

**Decision 5: Quality Score Threshold 80-90/100**

## Conclusion

The AI Writing Guide vision centers on a simple but powerful idea: **prove the framework works by using it ourselves.**

The contributor workflow feature serves as both critical functionality (enabling community growth) and strategic validation (demonstrating self-application). By developing this feature with complete SDLC artifacts - from intake through production deployment - we establish credible proof that AIWG can manage real-world development at scale.

**Key Takeaways:**

1. **Self-Application First:** Every AIWG feature developed using full SDLC process, starting with contributor workflow
2. **Show, Don't Tell:** Visible artifacts in `.aiwg/` directory provide reference implementation
3. **Quality Without Friction:** Processes enhance velocity through automation and agent-assisted generation
4. **Community Validation:** Contributor success proves framework works beyond just ourselves
5. **Iterative Maturity:** Phase 1 establishes foundation, Phases 2-4 validate and scale

**MVP Definition Reaffirmed:** Functional contributor workflow with complete traceable artifacts (intake → architecture → testing → deployment) demonstrating full SDLC cycle on production feature.

**Next Steps:**
1. Publish this vision document to `.aiwg/requirements/vision-document.md` (COMPLETE)
2. Communication to stakeholders (README update, case study planning)
3. Execution of Phase 1 roadmap with vision as North Star
4. Continuous iteration based on dogfooding learnings

## Appendix F: Alternatives Considered for Self-Application Proof

**Alternative 1: Build multi-platform support with full SDLC**
- **Pro:** Addresses secondary intake requirement (OpenAI/Codex support)
- **Con:** Doesn't solve maintainer scalability bottleneck (support capacity)
- **Rejected:** Lower strategic value, doesn't enable community growth

**Alternative 2: Self-apply to existing feature (markdown linting tools)**
- **Pro:** Smaller scope, lower complexity, tools already functional
- **Con:** No new functionality to demonstrate, doesn't address bottlenecks
- **Rejected:** Insufficient proof-of-concept value (tools too simple)

**Alternative 3: Create synthetic demo project (separate repository)**
- **Pro:** Lower risk, controlled narrative, can tailor for demonstration
- **Con:** "Do as I say not as I do" perception undermines credibility
- **Rejected:** Doesn't address real project needs, lacks authenticity

**Chosen: Contributor workflow with full SDLC**
- **Rationale:** Dual purpose (critical functionality + demonstration vehicle)
- **Addresses:** Maintainer scalability, community growth, self-application proof
- **Aligns:** Intake priorities (speed 0.40, support capacity bottleneck)
