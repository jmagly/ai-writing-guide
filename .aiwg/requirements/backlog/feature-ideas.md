# Feature Ideas Backlog

**Status**: DEFERRED TO ELABORATION
**Created**: 2025-10-18
**Phase**: Captured during Inception (Week 2)
**Triage Date**: Week 5+ (Elaboration phase)

**Instructions**: Do NOT elaborate these features until after Inception gate decision (Nov 14, 2025). This backlog captures ideas to prevent loss, but Inception focus remains on plugin system architecture baseline.

## Feature Ideas (Captured During Inception)

### From Architecture Work (SAD v1.0 Multi-Agent Review)

**Plugin System Enhancements**:
- [ ] **Plugin marketplace/registry** - Centralized discovery beyond filesystem scanning, version management, popularity metrics
- [ ] **Plugin signing and verification** - Cryptographic signing for security, trust model, certificate management
- [ ] **Plugin analytics** - Usage tracking, popularity metrics, adoption analytics
- [ ] **WebAssembly plugin sandboxing** - Advanced isolation beyond filesystem boundaries, run untrusted plugins safely

**Security Enhancements** (from Security Architect review):
- [ ] **Advanced dependency verification** - Cryptographic hash verification, lock file integrity, supply chain security
- [ ] **Runtime security monitoring** - Plugin behavior monitoring, anomaly detection, automatic sandboxing
- [ ] **Security audit trail** - Plugin installation/activation logging, security event tracking

**Testability Enhancements** (from Test Architect review):
- [ ] **Automated rollback testing** - Comprehensive rollback scenario validation, snapshot integrity tests
- [ ] **Performance regression detection** - Automated performance baseline tracking, CI/CD integration
- [ ] **Cross-platform compatibility testing** - Multi-OS validation (Linux, macOS, Windows)

### From User Questions (Oct 18, 2025)

**1. Research Team and Flows** (Priority: TBD)
- **Description**: Specialized team of agents and workflows for research and raw content analysis
- **Capabilities**:
  - Research content analysis (papers, documentation, codebases)
  - Source tracking and citation management
  - Working bibliography generation
  - Proper citation formatting (APA, MLA, Chicago, IEEE)
  - Source validation and verification
- **Use Cases**:
  - Technical research for architecture decisions
  - Competitive analysis and market research
  - Academic paper research for compliance/standards
  - Codebase analysis for legacy modernization
- **Potential Components**:
  - `research-analyst` agent (content analysis)
  - `librarian` agent (source tracking, citation management)
  - `/research-topic <topic> [--sources N]` command
  - `/cite-sources [--format apa|mla|chicago]` command
  - Research flow orchestration (parallel source analysis → synthesis → citation)
- **Rationale**: Many SDLC activities require research (architecture decisions, competitive analysis, standards compliance). Centralizing research capability with proper citation tracking improves quality and credibility.
- **Related To**: Architecture research (ADRs), requirements research (competitive analysis), compliance research (standards documentation)

**2. Backlog Management System** (Priority: TBD)
- **Description**: Comprehensive backlog management with automatic and interactive tools for prioritization, grooming, and sprint planning
- **Capabilities**:
  - Automated backlog grooming (stale issue detection, priority drift)
  - Interactive prioritization tools (t-shirt sizing, story points, WSJF)
  - Decision matrix-based prioritization (weighted factors: business value, effort, risk, dependencies)
  - Backlog health metrics (velocity tracking, WIP limits, cycle time)
  - Sprint planning automation (capacity-based assignment, dependency resolution)
- **Use Cases**:
  - Product backlog prioritization (roadmap planning)
  - Sprint planning (capacity vs demand balancing)
  - Technical debt management (prioritize refactoring)
  - Feature triage (many ideas → ranked backlog)
- **Potential Components**:
  - `backlog-manager` agent (automated grooming, health metrics)
  - `product-owner` agent (interactive prioritization, decision matrices)
  - `/backlog-groom [--auto|--interactive]` command
  - `/backlog-prioritize --method <tshirt|points|wsjf|matrix>` command
  - `/backlog-health` command (velocity, WIP, cycle time metrics)
  - `/sprint-plan <iteration> [--capacity <hours>]` command
  - Decision matrix templates (business value, effort, risk, strategic alignment)
- **Rationale**: Current SDLC framework lacks structured backlog management. Teams need prioritization tools beyond manual ranking. Decision matrices (like option-matrix.md) should be reusable for ongoing backlog grooming.
- **Related To**: Iteration planning, requirements evolution, product strategy

**3. Critical Evaluation Team/Posture** (Priority: TBD)
- **Description**: Specialized evaluation team and posture for critical assessment of project artifacts, plans, implementations, and metrics
- **Capabilities**:
  - Critical review of architecture decisions (challenge assumptions, identify risks)
  - Implementation quality evaluation (code quality, design patterns, technical debt)
  - Metrics validation (are we measuring the right things? gaming risk?)
  - Plan feasibility assessment (timeline realism, resource constraints, dependency risks)
  - Bias detection (confirmation bias, optimism bias, groupthink)
- **Use Cases**:
  - Pre-mortem analysis (what could go wrong?)
  - Architecture decision challenge (devil's advocate review)
  - Metrics audit (are success metrics meaningful?)
  - Plan sanity check (is this timeline realistic?)
  - Post-incident review (root cause analysis)
- **Potential Components**:
  - **Update existing agents** with critical evaluation mode:
    - `architecture-designer` → add "challenge mode" (question assumptions)
    - `requirements-analyst` → add "feasibility mode" (resource/timeline realism)
    - `test-architect` → add "risk mode" (what aren't we testing?)
    - `metrics-analyst` → add "validation mode" (are metrics gameable?)
  - **New agents**:
    - `devils-advocate` agent (challenge assumptions, identify blind spots)
    - `pre-mortem-facilitator` agent (failure scenario planning)
    - `bias-detector` agent (cognitive bias identification)
  - **New commands**:
    - `/critical-review <artifact> [--focus <area>]` command
    - `/pre-mortem <plan|project>` command
    - `/metrics-audit [--framework <DORA|custom>]` command
    - `/assumption-challenge <decision|plan>` command
  - **New flows**:
    - `flow-critical-evaluation-cycle` (periodic critical review)
    - `flow-pre-mortem` (before major decisions/launches)
- **Rationale**: SDLC frameworks often suffer from optimism bias and confirmation bias. Adding structured critical evaluation prevents groupthink and identifies blind spots before they become problems. This is especially important for solo developers (no team to challenge assumptions).
- **Related To**: Risk management, quality assurance, decision-making processes, continuous improvement

## Triage Process (Elaboration Phase)

**When to Triage**: Week 5+ (after Inception gate PASS/CONDITIONAL PASS on Nov 14)

**Triage Method**:
1. **Prioritization Framework**: Use decision matrix (business value, effort, risk, strategic alignment)
2. **Stakeholder Input**: Solo developer (Joseph Magly) ranks by value + effort
3. **Categorization**:
   - **Must-Have**: Critical for MVP, blocks other features
   - **Should-Have**: High value, reasonable effort, not blocking
   - **Nice-to-Have**: Low priority, deferred to future iterations
   - **Won't-Have**: Out of scope, reject

**Elaboration Activities**:
1. Select top 5-10 features for detailed elaboration
2. Write use cases (actors, flows, acceptance criteria)
3. Update SAD with architectural implications
4. Add to risk register (new features = new risks)
5. Estimate effort (story points, t-shirt sizes)
6. Plan Construction iterations

**Output**: Prioritized backlog ready for Construction phase iteration planning

## Notes

**Capture Guidelines**:
- Keep descriptions short during Inception (2-3 sentences max)
- Add "Rationale" if idea needs justification
- Link to related SAD sections, ADRs, or requirements if relevant
- Tag with source (user question, review feedback, architecture work)

**Elaboration Guidelines**:
- Expand to full use cases with actors, flows, acceptance criteria
- Architectural impact analysis (what changes to SAD/ADRs?)
- Effort estimation (story points, hours, t-shirt sizes)
- Dependency analysis (what must be done first?)
- Risk assessment (what could go wrong?)

**Backlog Health**:
- Current Size: 23 ideas captured
- Triage Pending: All items (Elaboration Week 5+)
- Priority Distribution: TBD (awaiting triage)
