## Executive Summary

**Overall Value Alignment Score**: 4.5/5

**Persona Coverage**: 100% (5/5 primary personas covered)

**Top Recommendation**: Validate UC-001 and UC-002 with 2-5 early adopters within first month. These two use cases drive immediate user value and validate product-market fit for both framework pillars (Writing Quality + SDLC).

**Critical Finding**: All five use cases demonstrate strong value alignment with vision. UC-003 (intake-from-codebase) provides exceptional differentiation but requires user validation to confirm 80-90% accuracy assumption. UC-004 and UC-005 validate framework sophistication but are secondary to initial adoption.

## 2. Persona Coverage Analysis

### 2.1 Primary Persona Mapping

| Persona | Primary Use Case | Secondary Use Cases | Coverage Assessment |
|---------|-----------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **AI Users** (writers, content creators) | UC-001 (AI Validation) | None (writing-focused) | **COMPLETE** - UC-001 addresses core need (authenticity) |
| **Agentic Developers** (Claude Code, Cursor users) | UC-002 (Deploy SDLC) | UC-003 (Intake Gen)<br>UC-004 (Multi-Agent) | **COMPLETE** - UC-002 (setup), UC-003 (brownfield), UC-004 (advanced) |
| **Enterprise Teams** (10+ devs, compliance needs) | UC-004 (Multi-Agent Workflows) | UC-002 (Deploy)<br>UC-003 (Intake Gen) | **COMPLETE** - UC-004 (audit trails), UC-002 (deployment at scale) |
| **Small Teams** (2-5 devs, collaborative) | UC-002 (Deploy SDLC) | UC-004 (Multi-Agent) | **COMPLETE** - UC-002 (shared structure), UC-004 (lightweight review) |
| **Future Contributors** (framework maintainers) | UC-005 (Self-Improvement) | UC-002 (Deploy)<br>UC-004 (Multi-Agent) | **COMPLETE** - UC-005 (dogfooding), UC-002 (onboarding) |

**Analysis**:

- **100% primary persona coverage** (5/5 personas have primary use case)
- **Strong secondary coverage** (3-4 personas have 2-3 supporting use cases)
- **No persona gaps identified**

### 2.2 Secondary Persona Assessment

#### Solo Developers (Persona: Agentic Developers subset)

- **Primary**: UC-002 (Deploy SDLC) - Setup friction <15 min
- **Secondary**: UC-003 (Intake Gen) - Brownfield formalization
- **Gap**: None (covered by Agentic Developers)

#### Contributors (Persona: Future Contributors)

- **Primary**: UC-005 (Self-Improvement) - Understand framework via dogfooding
- **Secondary**: UC-002 (Deploy) - Contributor onboarding
- **Gap**: None (UC-005 explicitly targets contributors)

#### Platform Vendors (Stakeholder, not user persona)

- **Coverage**: Implicit via UC-002 (multi-platform support)
- **Gap**: No explicit use case for vendor feedback loop (acceptable, stakeholders not primary users)

### 2.3 Missing Workflows Identification

**Potential Gaps**:

1. **Team Coordination Workflows** (Small Teams, Enterprise Teams):
   - **Gap**: No explicit use case for team profile management, agent assignment coordination
   - **Mitigation**: Vision Section 4.3 mentions team coordination features (MEDIUM priority), currently basic support
   - **Recommendation**: If 3+ teams request coordination features in Phase 1, prioritize team-profile-editor command

2. **Security and Compliance Workflows** (Enterprise Teams):
   - **Gap**: UC-004 mentions audit trails but no explicit security review use case
   - **Mitigation**: Vision includes security-review-cycle command (already exists)
   - **Recommendation**: Validate enterprise teams adopt security commands, add UC-006 if usage high

3. **Performance Optimization Workflows** (All Users):
   - **Gap**: No use case for performance baseline, optimization cycles
   - **Mitigation**: Vision includes performance-optimization command (exists), low priority until scale triggers
   - **Recommendation**: Defer unless performance reports emerge (triggered optimization strategy)

**Conclusion**: No critical workflow gaps. Team coordination and security workflows exist in framework but lack explicit use case documentation. Acceptable for Phase 1 (validate core workflows first).

## 3. MVP Alignment Validation

### 3.1 Ship-Now Scope Assessment

**Vision MVP Definition** (Section 2.1):

- Solo developer + 0-3 contributors
- Zero budget
- Ship-now mindset (iterate based on feedback)
- Modular deployment
- Self-service infrastructure

#### UC-001: Validate AI-Generated Content

**Ship-Now Readiness**: YES

- **Complexity**: Low (writing-validator agent exists, banned-patterns.md comprehensive)
- **Dependencies**: Validation documents (exist), sophistication guide (exists)
- **Effort**: <40 hours implementation (agent refinement, example gallery)
- **Risk**: False positives (mitigated by user feedback, iterative refinement)

**MVP Fit**: Core functionality, primary use case for AI Users persona, validates Writing Quality Framework pillar

#### UC-002: Deploy SDLC Framework

**Ship-Now Readiness**: YES

- **Complexity**: Low (deploy-agents.mjs exists, 61 agents exist, CLI exists)
- **Dependencies**: aiwg CLI (exists), agent definitions (exist)
- **Effort**: <20 hours implementation (polish install script, deployment validation)
- **Risk**: Platform conflicts (mitigated by multi-provider support, dry-run mode)

**MVP Fit**: Critical for adoption, enables all downstream workflows, validates SDLC Framework pillar

#### UC-003: Generate Intake from Codebase

**Ship-Now Readiness**: YES (with validation caveat)

- **Complexity**: Medium (intake-from-codebase command exists, Intake Coordinator agent exists)
- **Dependencies**: Git repository, codebase documentation (README.md improves accuracy 40-60%)
- **Effort**: <60 hours implementation (improve accuracy, interactive refinement mode)
- **Risk**: 80-90% accuracy assumption unvalidated (requires user testing)

**MVP Fit**: High value differentiation (eliminates brownfield friction), validates framework ROI claim (30-60 min saved)

**Recommendation**: Ship with clear accuracy expectations. If user testing reveals <70% accuracy, iterate based on feedback (ship-now mindset).

#### UC-004: Multi-Agent Workflows

**Ship-Now Readiness**: YES (basic), DEFER (advanced features)

- **Complexity**: High (orchestration patterns documented, Task tool integration required)
- **Dependencies**: Claude Code as Core Orchestrator, CLAUDE.md orchestration prompts (exist)
- **Effort**: <80 hours implementation (orchestrator validation, parallel reviewer patterns)
- **Risk**: Reviewer conflicts (mitigation: synthesizer consensus logic), context window exhaustion (mitigation: chunked review)

**MVP Fit**: Validates framework sophistication but secondary to UC-001/UC-002 for initial adoption

**Recommendation**: Ship basic multi-agent workflow (SAD generation) for Phase 1. Defer advanced features (configurable reviewer panels, consensus voting) to Phase 2 based on enterprise adoption.

#### UC-005: Framework Self-Improvement

**Ship-Now Readiness**: YES (dogfooding in progress)

- **Complexity**: Medium (iteration workflows exist, retrospective templates exist)
- **Dependencies**: Framework artifacts (requirements, architecture, tests) generated for framework itself
- **Effort**: <40 hours per iteration (maintainer effort already committed)
- **Risk**: Meta-complexity (mitigated by clear separation of meta vs user-facing artifacts)

**MVP Fit**: Validates framework practicality but user-invisible (does not directly drive adoption)

**Recommendation**: Continue self-application (this intake is part of UC-005 testing). Publish artifacts publicly at 6-month milestone as case study.

### 3.2 Modular Deployment Support Validation

**Vision Requirement** (Section 7.3): Users load subsets for project type (general writing, SDLC, or both)

| Use Case | Deployment Mode | Modular? | Validation |
|----------|----------------|----------|------------|
| UC-001 (AI Validation) | `--mode general` | YES | Deploys 3 writing agents only (writing-validator, prompt-optimizer, content-diversifier) |
| UC-002 (Deploy SDLC) | `--mode sdlc` | YES | Deploys 58 SDLC agents + 45 commands |
| UC-003 (Intake Gen) | `--mode sdlc` | YES | Part of SDLC mode (intake-coordinator agent) |
| UC-004 (Multi-Agent) | `--mode sdlc` | YES | Part of SDLC mode (architecture-designer, documentation-synthesizer, etc.) |
| UC-005 (Self-Improve) | `--mode sdlc` | YES | Framework uses SDLC mode on itself |

**Analysis**: All use cases support modular deployment. Users select deployment mode based on needs:

- **AI Users**: `--mode general` (3 agents, lightweight)
- **Agentic Developers**: `--mode sdlc` (58 agents, comprehensive)
- **Both**: `--mode both` (61 agents, full framework)

**Validation**: PASS - Modular deployment supported, context optimization confirmed

### 3.3 Effort Estimate Realism

**Vision Constraint** (Section 7.1): Solo developer sustainable at <10 hours/week

#### Implementation Effort (Pre-Launch)

| Use Case | Implementation Effort | Realistic? | Justification |
|----------|----------------------|------------|---------------|
| UC-001 | <40 hours | YES | Agent exists, requires refinement + examples |
| UC-002 | <20 hours | YES | CLI exists, requires polish + validation |
| UC-003 | <60 hours | YES | Command exists, requires accuracy improvements + interactive mode |
| UC-004 | <80 hours | MARGINAL | Orchestration patterns documented, Task tool integration complex |
| UC-005 | <40 hours/iteration | YES | Maintainer already committing time, dogfooding in progress |
| **Total** | 240 hours | YES | 24 weeks @ 10 hours/week = 6 months (aligns with Phase 2 timeline) |

**Analysis**:

- **UC-001, UC-002, UC-003**: Core functionality, realistic estimates
- **UC-004**: Complex orchestration, 80 hours marginal but achievable if prioritized
- **UC-005**: Ongoing effort, <40 hours/iteration aligns with maintainer capacity

**Recommendation**: Prioritize UC-001 and UC-002 for Phase 1 (0-3 months). Defer UC-004 advanced features to Phase 2 (3-6 months) if initial adoption validates demand.

| Use Case | Time to First Value | Vision Alignment | User Survey Question |
|----------|---------------------|------------------|---------------------|
| UC-001 (AI Validation) | 44-74 min (first doc)<br>30-60 min (after learning) | <30 min after learning curve (YES) | "How long to validate first document?" (target: <60 min) |
| UC-002 (Deploy SDLC) | 10 min | <30 min (YES) | "How long from install to first artifact generation?" (target: <15 min) |
| UC-003 (Intake Gen) | 18-35 min | <30 min (YES) | "How long to generate intake from codebase?" (target: <30 min) |
| UC-004 (Multi-Agent) | 31-51 min | <60 min (YES) | "How long to generate first comprehensive artifact?" (target: <60 min) |
| UC-005 (Self-Improve) | 6-10 hours/iteration | N/A (maintainer-facing) | N/A (measured via velocity metrics) |

**Analysis**:

- **UC-001, UC-002, UC-003**: All achieve <30 min time to first value (quick wins)
- **UC-004**: 31-51 min acceptable for comprehensive artifacts (Enterprise Teams expect depth)
- **UC-005**: Not user-facing, measured via framework velocity improvements

**Validation**: PASS - All user-facing use cases achieve <60 min time to first value

### 4.2 Time Savings Quantification

**Vision Target** (Section 6.2): 30-40% of surveyed users report measurable time savings (3-6 months)

| Use Case | Time Saved | Reduction % | Survey Question | Target Response Rate |
|----------|------------|-------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| UC-001 | 56-126 min/doc | 56-63% | "How much time saved vs manual AI pattern detection?" | 30-40% report "30+ min saved" |
| UC-002 | 5.8-10.8 hours | 98% | "How much time saved vs manual SDLC template setup?" | 50%+ report "5+ hours saved" |
| UC-003 | 117-205 min | 81-85% | "How much time saved vs manual intake form completion?" | 40-50% report "60+ min saved" |
| UC-004 | 8.5-14.5 hours | 92-96% | "How much time saved vs manual artifact coordination?" | 30-40% report "8+ hours saved" |
| UC-005 | 5-8 hours/iteration | 20-30% | N/A (internal) | N/A (measured via retrospectives) |

**Analysis**:

- **UC-002 and UC-003**: Exceptional time savings (80-98% reduction), likely to exceed 40% positive response rate
- **UC-001 and UC-004**: Strong time savings (56-96% reduction), aligns with 30-40% target
- **UC-005**: Moderate time savings (20-30% reduction), measured internally

**Recommendation**: Emphasize UC-002 and UC-003 time savings in marketing (5+ hours saved). These drive adoption via quick wins.

### 4.3 Self-Improvement Loop Enablement

**Vision Target** (Section 6.4): Framework artifacts improve development velocity

**UC-005 Success Criteria**:

- **3 months**: 50% of new features have SDLC artifacts
- **6 months**: 75% of new features have SDLC artifacts
- **9 months**: 100% of new features have SDLC artifacts (full self-application)

**Validation Mechanism**:

1. **Artifact Traceability**: Count features in `.aiwg/requirements/` with corresponding architecture, test plans, retrospectives
2. **Velocity Measurement**: Compare iteration time before/after SDLC artifact adoption (via retrospective surveys)
3. **Rework Reduction**: Track defect rate (target <10% rework due to missed requirements)

**Current Status** (from UC-005 Notes):

- Early/experimental stage (this intake is part of self-application testing)
- Success criteria: Framework artifacts improve development velocity and quality

**Recommendation**: Commit to 3-month milestone (50% artifacts) as forcing function. If velocity improves, continue to 6-month and 9-month milestones. If velocity degrades, reassess artifact depth (risk of over-engineering identified in UC-005).

## 5. Prioritization Recommendations

### 5.1 Priority Assignment Validation

**Vision Priority Key** (Section 4.3):

- HIGH = Current (v0.1 pre-launch)
- MEDIUM = Planned (v0.2-0.3, next 1-6 months)
- LOW = Backlog (conditional on adoption/feedback)

| Use Case | UC Priority | Vision Feature Priority | Alignment | Recommendation |
|----------|------------|------------------------|-----------|----------------|
| UC-001 (AI Validation) | HIGH | HIGH (Avoid AI detection patterns) | ALIGNED | Validate with 2-5 early adopters in Phase 1 |
| UC-002 (Deploy SDLC) | HIGH | HIGH (Deploy agents easily) | ALIGNED | Critical path for all downstream workflows |
| UC-003 (Intake Gen) | HIGH | HIGH (Generate intake from codebase) | ALIGNED | Differentiation for brownfield projects |
| UC-004 (Multi-Agent) | HIGH | MEDIUM (Team coordination features) | PARTIAL | Ship basic, defer advanced features to Phase 2 |
| UC-005 (Self-Improve) | MEDIUM | MEDIUM (Community self-service) | ALIGNED | Continue dogfooding, publish artifacts at 6-month milestone |

**Analysis**:

- **UC-001, UC-002, UC-003**: Priority alignment confirmed, all HIGH for Phase 1
- **UC-004**: Use case priority HIGH but Vision feature priority MEDIUM (team coordination). Recommendation: Ship basic multi-agent workflow for Phase 1 (validate orchestration pattern), defer advanced features to Phase 2

## 6. Risk Assessment and Mitigation

### 6.1 Critical Risks (High Impact)

#### Risk 1: UC-003 Accuracy Assumption Unvalidated

**Risk**: 80-90% field accuracy claim in UC-003 is unvalidated. If user testing reveals <70% accuracy, brownfield adoption fails.

**Impact**: HIGH (UC-003 differentiation depends on accuracy)

**Likelihood**: MEDIUM (command exists but not tested with real users)

**Mitigation**:

1. **Test with 5 brownfield codebases** (varying size, language, documentation quality) before Phase 1 launch
2. **Ship with clear accuracy expectations** ("80-90% accuracy for documented codebases, lower for sparse repos")
3. **Interactive refinement mode** to fill gaps (user answers strategic questions if confidence low)
4. **Fallback to manual intake** if accuracy <70% (acceptable, still faster than manual form-filling)

**Trigger**: If user testing reveals <70% accuracy in 3+ codebases, pivot to assisted intake (agent generates draft, user completes) instead of automated intake

#### Risk 2: UC-004 Context Window Exhaustion

**Risk**: Large SADs (10,000+ words) exceed reviewer context limits, multi-agent workflow fails.

**Impact**: MEDIUM-HIGH (affects Enterprise Teams persona)

**Likelihood**: LOW-MEDIUM (most SADs <5,000 words, but outliers exist)

**Mitigation**:

1. **Chunked review for large documents** (split into sections, review in parallel)
2. **Configurable artifact size limits** (warn if SAD >8,000 words, suggest splitting)
3. **Progressive review** (primary author generates executive summary + detailed sections separately)

**Trigger**: If 2+ users report context window errors, implement chunked review

#### Risk 3: UC-001 False Positives (Legitimate Sophisticated Language Flagged)

**Risk**: Zero false positives target in UC-001 is ambitious. If writing-validator flags domain-specific jargon as AI patterns, users lose trust.

**Impact**: MEDIUM (affects AI Users persona adoption)

**Likelihood**: MEDIUM (domain-specific jargon varies widely, hard to codegen)

**Mitigation**:

1. **User feedback loop** ("Flag this as false positive" button in feedback report)
2. **Domain-specific validation profiles** (academic, technical, marketing, creative)
3. **Iterative refinement of banned-patterns.md** based on false positive reports

**Trigger**: If 10%+ of flagged patterns reported as false positives, implement domain-specific profiles

### 6.2 Moderate Risks (Medium Impact)

#### Risk 4: UC-002 Platform Conflicts (Cursor/OpenAI)

**Risk**: Agent deployment conflicts with existing Cursor/OpenAI configurations, users cannot deploy.

**Impact**: MEDIUM (affects Agentic Developers persona)

**Likelihood**: LOW-MEDIUM (multi-provider support exists but not tested at scale)

**Mitigation**:

1. **Dry-run mode** (`aiwg -deploy-agents --dry-run`) to preview changes
2. **Backup existing .claude/ directory** before deployment
3. **Rollback command** (`aiwg -rollback`) to undo deployment
4. **Platform-specific deployment flags** (`--provider claude|openai`)

**Trigger**: If 3+ users report deployment conflicts, implement automatic backup + rollback

#### Risk 5: UC-005 Over-Engineering (Meta-Complexity)

**Risk**: Framework spends more time on SDLC artifacts than implementation, velocity degrades.

**Impact**: MEDIUM (affects maintainer capacity)

**Likelihood**: LOW-MEDIUM (solo developer can adjust artifact depth)

**Mitigation**:

1. **Measure velocity in retrospectives** (compare iteration time before/after SDLC artifacts)
2. **Adjust artifact depth** if velocity degrades (lighter requirements, skip detailed test plans)
3. **Clear separation of meta vs user-facing artifacts** (store framework development in `.aiwg/meta/`)

**Trigger**: If velocity degrades 20%+ in 2+ iterations, reduce artifact depth

### 6.3 Low Risks (Low Impact or Likelihood)

#### Risk 6: UC-004 Reviewer Conflict Resolution

**Risk**: Security Architect and Requirements Analyst provide contradictory feedback, synthesizer cannot resolve.

**Impact**: LOW (rare, affects <5% of workflows)

**Likelihood**: LOW (most feedback complementary, not contradictory)

**Mitigation**:

1. **Synthesizer flags unresolvable conflicts for user decision**
2. **Consensus voting** (require 3/4 APPROVED to BASELINE, otherwise iterate)

**Trigger**: If 10%+ of workflows report unresolvable conflicts, implement consensus voting

### 7.3 Top Recommendations

#### Recommendation 1: Prioritize UC-001 and UC-002 for Phase 1 (0-3 Months)

**Rationale**:

- UC-002 (Deploy SDLC) is critical path for all downstream workflows
- UC-001 (AI Validation) validates Writing Quality Framework pillar
- Both deliver quick wins (<30 min time to first value)
- Combined implementation effort <60 hours (achievable at 10 hours/week)

**Success Metrics**:

- 10+ successful installations (UC-002)
- AI detection baseline established (UC-001)
- 2-5 early adopters report feedback

#### Recommendation 2: Validate UC-003 Accuracy Assumption Before Launch

**Rationale**:

- 80-90% field accuracy is unvalidated
- Brownfield adoption depends on accuracy (30-60 min saved claim)
- Risk of user dissatisfaction if accuracy <70%

**Action Items**:

1. Test intake-from-codebase with 5 brownfield codebases (varying size, language, documentation)
2. Measure field accuracy (% of fields correctly populated)
3. Ship with clear expectations if accuracy 70-90%
4. Implement interactive refinement mode if accuracy <70%

**Trigger**: If accuracy >80% in 4/5 test codebases, proceed to Phase 1 launch. If accuracy <70% in 3+ codebases, pivot to assisted intake (agent generates draft, user completes).

#### Recommendation 3: Ship Basic UC-004 (Multi-Agent) in Phase 1, Defer Advanced Features to Phase 2

**Rationale**:

- Basic orchestration pattern validates framework sophistication
- Advanced features (configurable reviewer panels, consensus voting) depend on enterprise adoption
- Effort savings: 80 hours (basic) vs 140 hours (basic + advanced)

**Phase 1 Scope**:

- Primary Author â†’ Parallel Reviewers â†’ Synthesizer â†’ Archive (SAD generation)
- 3-4 reviewers (Security Architect, Test Architect, Requirements Analyst, Technical Writer)
- Fixed reviewer panel (no customization)

**Phase 2 Scope** (conditional on 5+ enterprise teams):

- Configurable reviewer panels (user selects 2-6 reviewers)
- Consensus voting (require 3/4 APPROVED to BASELINE)
- Diff reporting (compare draft vs final, highlight synthesizer changes)

#### Recommendation 4: Commit to UC-005 3-Month Milestone (50% Artifacts)

**Rationale**:

- Self-application validates framework practicality
- Dogfooding reveals friction points early
- Public artifacts demonstrate credibility (6-month case study)

**Action Items**:

1. Track artifact coverage (% of new features with requirements, architecture, tests)
2. Measure velocity in retrospectives (iteration time before/after artifacts)
3. Publish framework artifacts publicly at 6-month milestone
4. Pivot if velocity degrades 20%+ in 2+ iterations (reduce artifact depth)

**Milestones**:

- 3 months: 50% of new features have SDLC artifacts
- 6 months: 75% of new features have SDLC artifacts (publish case study)
- 9 months: 100% of new features have SDLC artifacts (full self-application)

#### Recommendation 5: Emphasize UC-002 and UC-003 Time Savings in Marketing

**Rationale**:

- UC-002: 5.8-10.8 hours saved (98% time reduction) - exceptional ROI
