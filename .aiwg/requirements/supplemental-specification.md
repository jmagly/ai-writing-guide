## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

This Supplemental Specification defines all **non-functional requirements (NFRs)** for the AI Writing Guide (AIWG) project. These requirements complement functional requirements captured in use case specifications (UC-001 through UC-012) by specifying quality attributes, performance targets, security controls, usability standards, and compliance obligations.

**New in Version 1.1**: This update incorporates 48 NFRs extracted during Elaboration Week 4 requirements workshop, providing comprehensive coverage of all use cases with prioritized implementation roadmap.

**New in Version 1.2**: This update adds 34 NFRs from Elaboration Week 5 use case elaboration (UC-006, UC-008, UC-009, UC-011), expanding total coverage to 82 NFRs with refined P0/P1/P2 prioritization for Construction phase.

### 1.2 Scope

This document covers NFRs for:

- **Writing Quality Framework**: AI pattern detection, content validation, authenticity scoring
- **SDLC Framework**: 58 agents, 42+ commands, multi-agent orchestration, plugin system
- **CLI Tooling**: Installation, deployment, project scaffolding
- **Infrastructure**: GitHub repository, CI/CD pipelines, documentation generation
- **Workspace Management**: Framework-scoped context loading, tier-based filtering (FID-007)

**Out of Scope**: Functional requirements (captured in use case specifications), implementation details (captured in Software Architecture Document).

### 1.3 Intended Audience

- **Project Manager**: Resource planning, schedule validation, risk assessment
- **Architecture Designer**: Architecture trade-off decisions, technology selection
- **Test Architect**: Test strategy development, validation criteria, coverage targets
- **Security Architect**: Security control design, threat modeling, compliance validation
- **Requirements Analyst**: Requirements traceability, acceptance criteria definition
- **Stakeholders**: Quality expectations, performance commitments, compliance assurance

### 1.4 Document Organization

Sections 2-12 define NFR categories (Performance, Throughput, Accuracy, Quality, Completeness, Security, Reliability, Usability, Data Retention, Freshness, Scalability). Each section provides:

- **Category Overview**: Why this quality attribute matters for AIWG
- **Specific Requirements**: Measurable targets with requirement IDs (NFR-XXX-##)
- **Priority Classification**: P0 (Make-or-Break for MVP), P1 (High Value, Post-MVP), P2 (Nice-to-Have, Future)
- **Rationale**: Business justification for each target
- **Testing Approach**: Automated, Manual, or Statistical validation methodology
- **Traceability**: Links to use cases, architecture components, test cases, and design decisions

Section 13 defines regulatory and compliance NFRs. Section 14 defines quality metrics and Service Level Indicators (SLIs). Section 15 summarizes NFR prioritization strategy. Section 16 provides comprehensive traceability matrix.

### 1.5 Profile Context

**Current Profile**: MVP transitioning to Production (from Solution Profile document)

**Priority Weights**:
- Delivery speed: 40% (ship-now mindset, validate assumptions fast)
- Cost efficiency: 20% (solo developer, time-constrained)
- Quality/security: 20% (accepting technical debt short-term, will increase post-validation)
- Reliability/scale: 20% (pre-launch, 0 users currently, scale not yet concern)

**Implications for NFRs**:
- Performance targets set for current scale (1-10 users), not enterprise scale (1000+ users)
- Security controls appropriate for open-source documentation project (no PII, no sensitive data)
- Testing coverage targets 60-80% (not 95%+ like regulated systems)
- Monitoring minimal (GitHub metrics only, no runtime telemetry)

**Transition Plan**: When AIWG reaches Production profile (6 months, 100+ users, 2-3 contributors), NFR targets will be reassessed:
- Quality/security priority increases to 40-45%
- Performance targets tighten (p95 → p99 latencies)
- Testing coverage increases to 80-95%
- Monitoring maturity increases (runtime metrics, alerting, SLOs)

### 1.6 NFR Prioritization Framework

**Priority Definitions** (established during Elaboration Week 4 requirements workshop):

| Priority | Criteria | Target Release | Rationale |
|----------|----------|----------------|-----------|
| **P0 (Make-or-Break)** | Enterprise blocker if missing, direct user impact, competitive disadvantage | MVP (Iterations 1-5) | Must have for MVP launch, core value delivery |
| **P1 (High Value)** | Significant user benefit, competitive advantage, quality enabler | Version 1.1 (3 months post-MVP) | High-value enhancements, deferred to reduce MVP scope |
| **P2 (Nice-to-Have)** | Incremental improvement, edge case coverage, polish | Version 2.0+ (Backlog) | Nice-to-have features, optimization opportunities |

**NFR Distribution**:
- **P0**: 12 NFRs (25% of total) - Security, Usability, Performance, Accuracy
- **P1**: 18 NFRs (37.5% of total) - Quality, Completeness, Security, Usability
- **P2**: 18 NFRs (37.5% of total) - Throughput, Reliability, Data Retention, Scalability

**Strategic Rationale**: Focus MVP on 12 "make-or-break" NFRs covering security, usability, and performance. Defer 36 NFRs (P1/P2) to accelerate time-to-market while maintaining core value proposition.

## 8. Regulatory and Compliance Requirements

### 13.1 Overview

As an open-source documentation and tooling project, AIWG has minimal regulatory obligations. However, responsible data handling and security practices are maintained.

**Compliance Philosophy**: "Security by design, privacy by default" - protect user data, prevent malicious attacks, maintain trust.

---

### NFR-COMP-001: Open Source Licensing

**Requirement**: All AIWG components licensed under MIT License (permissive, commercial-friendly).

**Rationale**: MIT License maximizes adoption, enables commercial use, minimizes legal friction.

**Traceability**:
- README.md: License section
- LICENSE file (repository root)

---

### NFR-COMP-002: Dependency Licensing

**Requirement**: All dependencies use permissive licenses (MIT, Apache 2.0, BSD).

**Rationale**: Copyleft licenses (GPL) create legal constraints, reduce commercial adoption.

**Validation**: `npm audit` (Node.js), `pip-licenses` (Python) - verify all dependencies permissive

**Traceability**:
- package.json (Node.js dependencies)
- requirements.txt (Python dependencies)

---

### NFR-COMP-003: Data Privacy

**Requirement**: No user data collected or transmitted externally (100% local processing).

**Rationale**: User content may contain confidential information. Zero data collection ensures privacy, enables enterprise adoption.

**Validation**: Network monitoring (verify zero external API calls during operation)

**Traceability**:
- NFR-SEC-001: Content Privacy (No External API Calls)
- UC-001: Validate AI-Generated Content (AC-003: privacy)

---

### NFR-COMP-004: Security Vulnerability Disclosure

**Requirement**: Security vulnerabilities disclosed responsibly via SECURITY.md policy.

**Rationale**: Transparent vulnerability disclosure builds trust, enables coordinated fixes.

**Traceability**:
- SECURITY.md file (repository root)
- GitHub Security Advisories (CVE reporting)

---

### 15.5 Strategic Rationale

**Focus MVP on 12 P0 NFRs**:
- Security (3 NFRs): Content privacy, file permissions, attack detection - enterprise blockers
- Usability (3 NFRs): Learning curve, setup time, error clarity - adoption barriers
- Performance (4 NFRs): Validation, deployment, analysis - user-facing operations
- Accuracy (2 NFRs): False positives, intake accuracy - trust builders

**Defer 36 NFRs (P1/P2) to accelerate MVP**:
- **Benefit**: Focuses MVP on critical NFRs (30 P0 out of 82 total = 37%)
- **Risk**: Acceptable - P1/P2 NFRs are enhancements, not blockers
- **Timeline Impact**: Defers 52 NFRs (P1/P2) to post-MVP releases

**Post-MVP Roadmap**:
- **Version 1.1** (3 months post-MVP): 30 P1 NFRs (quality, completeness, security, reliability)
- **Version 2.0** (6+ months post-MVP): 22 P2 NFRs (throughput, reliability, scalability)
