# Agent Assignments - Inception Phase

**Document Type**: Team Management
**Created**: 2025-10-17
**Author**: Intake Coordinator
**Status**: ACTIVE
**Project**: AI Writing Guide - Contributor Workflow Feature
**Phase**: Inception (Weeks 1-4)
**Related Documents**:
- Phase Plan: `.aiwg/planning/phase-plan-inception.md`

- Risk Register: `.aiwg/risks/risk-register.md`

## Executive Summary

This document defines agent assignments for the AIWG Inception phase, following the **Primary Author → Parallel Reviewers → Synthesizer → Archive** pattern. The Inception phase spans 4 weeks (October 17 - November 14, 2025) and coordinates 25+ specialized agents to deliver complete SDLC artifacts for the contributor workflow feature.

**Key Principles**:
- **Multi-Agent Orchestration**: Use parallel execution for independent review cycles
- **Single Responsibility**: Each agent has clear, focused deliverables
- **Quality Through Review**: 3-5 reviewers per major artifact
- **Efficient Context**: Agents receive only relevant templates and inputs
- **Traceability**: All assignments link to phase plan and deliverables

**Resource Optimization**:
- **Total Agent Invocations**: ~45-60 estimated (primary authoring + reviews + synthesis)
- **Parallel Execution**: 15-20 opportunities for concurrent agent work
- **Context Efficiency**: Template-driven prompts reduce context overhead
- **Time Savings**: Agent-assisted artifact generation targets <20% of development time

  - Synthesizer resolves conflicts with rationale
- **Consistency Enforcement**: When merging multiple perspectives
  - Ensure terminology, tone, structure consistency

**Synthesis Process**:
1. **Collect Reviews**: All reviewers save to `.aiwg/*/reviews/` directory
2. **Read Primary Draft**: Documentation Synthesizer reads original artifact
3. **Read All Reviews**: Synthesizer reads all review documents
4. **Merge Feedback**: Integrate all suggestions, resolve conflicts
5. **Final Quality Check**: Ensure consistency, completeness, quality bar
6. **Baseline**: Save final artifact to production location (not drafts/)

**Synthesis Outputs**:
- **SAD Final**: `.aiwg/planning/contributor-workflow/architecture/software-architecture-doc.md`
- **Metadata**: "Reviewed By" section listing all reviewers
- **Change Log**: Track what changed from primary draft (optional)

**Total Unique Agents**: 17 (out of 58 available SDLC agents)

### 6.2 Parallel Execution Opportunities

**15-20 opportunities for concurrent agent work**:

**Week 2 - SAD Multi-Agent Review** (4 agents parallel):
```
Security Architect + Test Architect + Requirements Analyst + Technical Writer
(All review SAD v0.1 concurrently, launched in single orchestration message)
```

**Week 2 - Platform Dependencies** (2 agents parallel):
```
DevOps Engineer (audit) + Security Architect (review)
(Can run concurrently with other work)
```

**Week 3 - Command Implementation** (2 agents parallel):
```
DevOps Engineer (Extended contributor commands) + DevOps Engineer (Maintainer commands)
(Independent implementations, can parallelize)
```

**Week 3 - Quality Gates + Commands** (2 agents parallel):
```
Build Engineer (Quality gates) + DevOps Engineer (Commands)
(Independent work, can run concurrently)
```

**Week 3 - Test Strategy Review** (2 agents parallel):
```
Test Architect (drafting) + Test Engineer (validation)
(Sequential within task, but can overlap with other work)
```

**Week 4 - Testing + Deployment** (2 agents parallel):
```
Test Engineer (manual testing) + Deployment Manager (deployment plan)
(Independent work, can run concurrently)
```

**Week 4 - Deployment + Documentation** (3 agents parallel):
```
Deployment Manager (validation) + Documentation Archivist (command reference) + Documentation Archivist (CHANGELOG)
(Independent work, can run concurrently)
```

**Week 4 - Gate Review Validation** (2 agents parallel):
```
Security Gatekeeper (gate report) + Traceability Manager (requirements validation)
(Coordinated review, can parallelize sections)
```

**Parallel Efficiency Gain**: Estimated 30-40% time savings vs sequential execution

### 6.3 Context Efficiency

**Template-Driven Prompts** (reduce context overhead):

- **Always include**:
  - Specific AIWG template path (from `~/.local/share/ai-writing-guide/agentic/code/frameworks/sdlc-complete/templates/`)
  - Relevant input artifacts (intake, vision, SAD, etc.)
  - Clear output path (where to save deliverable)
  - Success criteria (what defines "complete")

- **Avoid including**:
  - Entire AIWG repository (too much context)
  - Unrelated features (focus on contributor workflow only)
  - Implementation details (unless agent is implementing)

**Example Efficient Prompt** (Architecture Designer, SAD v0.1):
```
Read template: ~/.local/share/ai-writing-guide/agentic/code/frameworks/sdlc-complete/templates/analysis-design/software-architecture-doc-template.md
Read intake: .aiwg/intake/ (all forms)
Read vision: .aiwg/working/vision/vision-v1.0-final.md
Read existing tooling: tools/agents/deploy-agents.mjs, tools/install/install.sh

Create Software Architecture Document draft for contributor workflow feature.

Focus on:
- Component architecture (contributor commands, maintainer commands, quality gates)
- Data flows (contributor → fork → PR → maintainer review)
- Integration points (GitHub API, git operations, markdown linters)
- Security considerations (token handling, fork isolation)
- Deployment architecture (aiwg CLI update mechanism)

Output: .aiwg/planning/contributor-workflow/architecture/drafts/sad-v0.1-primary.md
Target: 3,000-5,000 words, 80%+ completeness
```

**Context Savings**: ~70% reduction vs "read all AIWG docs" approach

### 6.4 Time Allocation

**Target: Artifact generation <20% of total development time**

**Estimated Time Breakdown** (4-week Inception phase):

| Activity | Estimated Hours | % of Total |
|----------|----------------|-----------|
| Agent invocations (artifact drafting) | 28-35 hours | 15-18% |
| Maintainer review/editing (artifacts) | 10-15 hours | 5-8% |
| Implementation (11 commands) | 40-50 hours | 20-25% |
| Manual testing (dogfooding) | 12-16 hours | 6-8% |
| Documentation updates | 8-12 hours | 4-6% |
| Deployment validation | 6-10 hours | 3-5% |
| Retrospectives and planning | 10-15 hours | 5-8% |
| **Total** | **114-153 hours** | **100%** |

**Velocity Assessment**:
- **Total calendar time**: 4 weeks (28 days)
- **Working time**: 114-153 hours (~14-19 hours/week average)
- **Vs Target**: <15 hours/week target → **BORDERLINE** (may peak Week 3-4)
- **Mitigation**: Cut optional commands (status, monitor, respond) if Week 3 >15 hours

**Artifact Generation Time**:
- **Agent drafting**: 28-35 hours (15-18%)
- **Maintainer review**: 10-15 hours (5-8%)
- **Combined**: 38-50 hours (20-26%)
- **Vs Target**: <20% target → **AT RISK** (may slightly exceed)
- **Mitigation**: Use agents for all major artifacts (SAD, ADRs, test strategy, deployment plan)

## Agent Assignment Summary

### 7.1 Agent Utilization by Phase

**Week 1 (Foundation)**:
- Project Manager (phase plan, retro)
- Metrics Analyst (velocity baseline)
- Architecture Designer (SAD draft, ADR topics, initial ADRs)
- Maintainer (SAD self-review)

**Week 2 (Architecture Baseline)**:
- Architecture Designer (ADR completion)
- Security Architect (SAD review, dependency review)
- Test Architect (SAD review)
- Requirements Analyst (SAD review)
- Technical Writer (SAD review, ADR review)
- Documentation Synthesizer (SAD synthesis)
- DevOps Engineer (command implementation, platform audit)
- Project Manager (retro)

**Week 3 (Implementation & Testing)**:
- DevOps Engineer (command implementation x3)
- Build Engineer (quality gates)
- Security Gatekeeper (quality gate review)
- Test Architect (test strategy)
- Test Engineer (test strategy review, manual testing)
- UX Lead (friction analysis)
- Project Manager (retro)

**Week 4 (Deployment & Gate)**:
- Test Engineer (testing completion)
- Deployment Manager (deployment plan, validation)
- DevOps Engineer (deployment review)
- Documentation Archivist (command reference, CHANGELOG)
- Technical Writer (command reference review)
- Project Manager (phase retro, retro, coordination)
- Support Lead (phase retro review)
- Security Gatekeeper (gate review)
- Traceability Manager (gate review validation)

### 7.2 Critical Path Agents

**Blockers** (if these agents don't deliver, phase stalls):

1. **Architecture Designer** (Week 1-2): SAD and ADRs must be baselined before implementation
2. **Documentation Synthesizer** (Week 2): SAD synthesis blocks implementation start
3. **DevOps Engineer** (Week 2-3): Command implementation critical path
4. **Test Engineer** (Week 3-4): Manual testing validates quality
5. **Security Gatekeeper** (Week 4): Gate review decision blocks Elaboration entry

### 7.3 Optional/Deferrable Agents

**Can defer if time constrained**:

- **Metrics Analyst** (Week 1): Velocity baseline nice-to-have but not blocking
- **UX Lead** (Week 3): Friction analysis valuable but can be maintainer self-assessment
- **Support Lead** (Week 4): Phase retro review helpful but not critical

### 7.4 Agent Success Criteria

**For each agent assignment, success = deliverable meets quality bar**:

- **Architecture Designer**: SAD 80/100+, ADRs complete and justified
- **Documentation Synthesizer**: SAD synthesis integrates all feedback, no conflicts
- **DevOps Engineer**: Commands functional, quality gates enforced
- **Test Engineer**: Manual testing complete, friction points documented
- **Security Gatekeeper**: Gate review objective, decision clear
- **Project Manager**: Retrospectives honest, improvements actionable

## Risk Management

### 8.1 Agent Assignment Risks

**R-AGENT-01: Agent Context Inefficiency**
- **Risk**: Agents receive too much context, produce generic outputs
- **Impact**: Time wasted on revisions, quality suffers
- **Mitigation**:
  - Template-driven prompts (specific AIWG templates, not full repo)
  - Clear success criteria in each assignment
  - Limit inputs to relevant artifacts only
- **Owner**: Project Manager (monitor agent efficiency)

**R-AGENT-02: Review Cycle Delays**
- **Risk**: Multi-agent review cycles take longer than sequential work
- **Impact**: Week 2 slips, impacts Week 3 implementation
- **Mitigation**:
  - Launch reviewers in parallel (single orchestration message)
  - Set tight deadlines (2 days for reviews)
  - Have synthesizer ready to merge immediately
- **Owner**: Project Manager (coordinate review cycles)

**R-AGENT-03: Agent Unavailability**
- **Risk**: Solo developer context, no backup if maintainer unavailable
- **Impact**: Phase stalls if maintainer sick, vacation, other priorities
- **Mitigation**:
  - Front-load critical work (SAD, ADRs in Week 1-2)
  - Buffer time in Week 4 (can absorb minor delays)
  - Defer optional work (status, monitor, respond commands)
- **Owner**: Maintainer (manage availability)

**R-AGENT-04: Agent Output Quality**
- **Risk**: Agents produce low-quality drafts, require significant rework
- **Impact**: Maintainer spends more time editing than drafting from scratch
- **Mitigation**:
  - Clear prompts with examples
  - Iterate on agent prompts if quality issues
  - Maintainer review all agent outputs (don't blindly accept)
- **Owner**: Maintainer (quality validation)

### 8.2 Mitigation Tracking

**Weekly Risk Review** (in weekly retrospectives):
- Did agents deliver quality outputs this week?
- Were review cycles efficient or delayed?
- Is maintainer workload sustainable?
- Any agent assignment changes needed for next week?
