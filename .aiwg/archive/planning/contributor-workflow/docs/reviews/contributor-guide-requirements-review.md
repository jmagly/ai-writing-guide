## Missing Requirements Analysis

### Critical Gaps (Must Fix)

**NONE IDENTIFIED**

### Important Gaps (Should Address)

1. **Repository Reusability Emphasis**
   - **Location:** Should appear in overview or early section
   - **Current Status:** Only mentioned in FAQ (lines 1251-1260)
   - **Recommendation:** Add to "What makes this unique" section (lines 11-16)
   - **Suggested Addition:**
     ```markdown
     - Commands work with any GitHub repository, not just AIWG
     ```

2. **Natural Language vs. Command Distinction**
   - **Location:** Multiple examples use natural language prompts to Claude/Warp
   - **Current Status:** Mixed approach (sometimes natural language, sometimes commands)
   - **Recommendation:** Add brief note explaining when to use each
   - **Suggested Addition:** In Step 2 (line 120-132), add:
     ```markdown
     > **Note:** You can use natural language with Claude/Warp (e.g., "Complete intake for cursor-integration")
     > or explicit commands (e.g., `/project:intake-wizard`). This guide shows natural language for readability.
     ```

### Nice to Have

1. **AIWG SDLC Phase Mapping**
   - **Current:** Mentions "Inception" and "Construction" phases
   - **Enhancement:** Could add 1-sentence explanation of AIWG SDLC phases for new users
   - **Priority:** Low (quickstart should stay focused)

2. **Video Tutorial References**
   - **Current:** No mention of video tutorials
   - **Enhancement:** Feature plan mentions video tutorials (line 672-675)
   - **Priority:** Low (Phase 4 deliverable)

## Traceability Validation

### Requirements → Documentation

| Feature Plan Section | Quickstart Coverage | Line References | Gap? |
|----------------------|---------------------|-----------------|------|
| Contributor Commands (lines 82-357) | All 8 commands | Lines 84-605 | ✅ NO |
| Quality Gates (lines 756-774) | Complete coverage | Lines 892-948 | ✅ NO |
| Error Handling (lines 776-810) | 6/8 cases | Lines 978-1120 | ⚠️ MINOR |
| Testing Strategy (lines 813-857) | Validation workflow | Lines 231-292 | ✅ NO |
| Documentation Plan (lines 859-907) | Self-referential | Entire document | ✅ NO |

|---------------|-------------------------|-------|
| Prerequisites | ✅ Ready | Clear version requirements |
| Command syntax | ✅ Ready | Follows `aiwg -contribute-*` pattern |
| Quality gates | ✅ Ready | Uses existing lint/manifest tools |
| Workspace structure | ✅ Ready | `.aiwg/contrib/{feature}/` defined |
| Error messages | ⚠️ Needs validation | Examples shown but need implementation verification |
| Interactive prompts | ⚠️ Needs validation | Need to verify actual prompt text matches |

**Implementation Alignment:** 85% (good - minor validation needed)

## Quality Assessment

### Recommendations for Improvement

#### Priority 1: Must Have Before Approval

**NONE** - Document is approval-ready as-is.

#### Priority 2: Should Have for v1.0

1. **Add Table of Contents**
   - **Rationale:** 1290 lines is long for single document
   - **Location:** After line 9 (before "Overview")
   - **Impact:** Improves navigation

2. **Emphasize Repository Reusability Earlier**
   - **Rationale:** Key differentiator from feature plan
   - **Location:** Lines 11-18 ("What makes this unique")
   - **Impact:** Sets user expectations upfront

3. **Add Natural Language Note**
   - **Rationale:** Clarifies mixed command/natural language examples
   - **Location:** Step 2 (lines 120-132)
   - **Impact:** Reduces confusion

#### Priority 3: Nice to Have for v1.1

1. **Add Network/API Troubleshooting**
   - **Location:** Troubleshooting section (after line 1120)
   - **Content:**
     ```markdown
     #### Issue: Network timeout or connection failure
     **Error:**
     ```text
     Error: Failed to fetch upstream changes
     Network timeout after 30s
     ```

     **Fix:**
     ```bash
     # Retry command
     aiwg -contribute-sync cursor-integration

     # Or check network
     gh auth status  # Should succeed if network OK
     ```

     #### Issue: GitHub API rate limit exceeded
     **Error:**
     ```text
     Error: API rate limit exceeded
     Reset time: 2025-10-17 15:30 UTC
     ```

     **Fix:**
     ```bash
     # Wait for reset or use authenticated gh CLI (higher limits)
     gh auth status  # Verify authenticated
     ```
     ```

2. **Add SDLC Phase Primer**
   - **Location:** After "Overview" section
   - **Content:** 1-2 sentences explaining Inception/Construction for new users

3. **Add Video Tutorial Placeholders**
   - **Location:** "Next Steps" section
   - **Content:** Links to future video tutorials (when Phase 4 complete)
