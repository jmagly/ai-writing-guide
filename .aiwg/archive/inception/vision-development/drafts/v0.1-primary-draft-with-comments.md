## 1 Introduction

The AI Writing Guide is a dual-purpose framework addressing two critical gaps in AI-assisted content creation and software development:

1. **Writing Quality Framework**: Guidelines, validation patterns, and agents to ensure AI-generated content maintains authentic, professional writing standards while avoiding detection patterns.

2. **SDLC Complete Framework**: Comprehensive software development lifecycle toolkit providing 58 specialized agents, 45 slash commands, and 156 templates for managing agentic coding projects from concept through production.

This vision document establishes the strategic direction for evolving from a solo-developed prototype (485+ files, 105 commits in 3 months) to a community-driven framework supporting individual developers, small teams, and enterprise organizations.

**Document Purpose**: This vision serves as the alignment reference for all stakeholders (current solo developer, planned 2-3 contributors within 6 months, early adopters) to ensure development priorities, feature decisions, and community-building efforts advance the core mission: making AI-assisted work more authentic, structured, and traceable.

## 2 Positioning

### 2.1 Problem Statement

**The problem of AI-generated content exhibiting formulaic patterns and agentic coding workflows lacking structured SDLC guidance** affects **writers, developers, and enterprise teams using AI assistants**, the impact of which is **reduced content authenticity, hard-to-process chat logs instead of structured artifacts, and missing compliance/audit trails**, a successful solution would **remove AI detection patterns while maintaining sophistication, provide comprehensive SDLC templates and agents from concept to production, and enable traceable artifacts that support enterprise compliance needs**.

### 2.2 Product Position Statement

**For writers, agentic developers, and enterprise teams**, who **need to produce authentic AI-assisted content and structured SDLC artifacts with compliance trails**, the **AI Writing Guide** is a **comprehensive documentation framework and agentic toolkit** that **eliminates AI detection patterns while preserving professional sophistication, and provides complete lifecycle support from intake through production deployment**. Unlike **generic writing guides or fragmented SDLC templates**, our product **combines context-optimized validation rules with 58 specialized agents, 45 workflows, and 156 templates in a single modular framework designed specifically for AI-assisted work**.

<!-- PRODUCT-STRATEGIST: STRONG positioning. Consider adding quantifiable ROI claim if user testing validates (e.g., "Reduces artifact generation time from hours to minutes"). Minor enhancement, not critical. -->

## 3 Stakeholder Descriptions

### 3.1 Stakeholder Summary

| Name | Description | Responsibilities |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Solo Developer** (Joseph Magly) | Framework creator, maintainer, primary contributor | Strategic direction, core development, community infrastructure, documentation, release management |
| **AI Users** (writers, content creators) | Individuals using AI assistants for writing | Consume writing guidelines, validate content against detection patterns, maintain authentic voice |
| **Agentic Developers** (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex users) | Developers using AI coding assistants for software projects | Deploy SDLC agents/commands, generate requirements/architecture artifacts, maintain traceability |
| **Enterprise Teams** (10+ developers) | Organizations requiring compliance and audit trails | Use full SDLC lifecycle support, maintain artifact traceability, meet compliance requirements (SOC2, HIPAA, PCI-DSS) |
| **Small Teams** (2-5 developers) | Collaborative projects needing shared structure | Deploy lightweight SDLC workflows, coordinate multi-agent artifact generation, maintain shared documentation |
| **Future Contributors** (2-3 within 6 months) | Developers contributing to framework evolution | Code review, feature development, documentation, community support |
| **GitHub Community** | Open source contributors, issue reporters | Report bugs, suggest features, contribute improvements, validate framework through usage |

### 3.2 User Environment

**Operational Context**:

- **Team Size**: Solo developers to enterprise teams (1-50+ developers)
- **Task Cycle Time**: Writing validation (seconds), SDLC artifact generation (minutes to hours), full phase transitions (days to weeks)
- **Environmental Constraints**:
  - Solo developer currently (limited support capacity)
  - Zero budget (volunteer time, free infrastructure)
  - Node.js >=18.20.8 required for tooling
  - GitHub repository as primary distribution channel
- **Platforms**: Claude Code (primary target), OpenAI/Codex (secondary support), Cursor (future consideration)
- **Integrations**: GitHub Actions (CI/CD), Git (version control), LLM chat interfaces (consumption)
- **Business Model**: Open source (MIT license), community-driven, no monetization currently planned

<!-- PRODUCT-STRATEGIST: Zero-budget sustainability unclear. Recommend adding explicit sustainability scenarios in Section 7.1: personal tool path (0-10 users), community path (10-100 users), commercial path (100+ users) with decision triggers for transition. -->

**User Workflows**:

1. **Writing Validation Workflow**:
   - User generates content via AI assistant
   - Loads validation documents into context
   - Reviews content against banned patterns
   - Rewrites flagged sections maintaining sophistication

2. **Agentic Development Workflow**:
   - Install framework via one-line bash script (`curl ... | bash`)
   - Deploy agents/commands to project (`.claude/agents/`, `.claude/commands/`)
   - Generate intake forms (`/intake-wizard`)
   - Progress through SDLC phases (Inception → Elaboration → Construction → Transition)
   - Generate structured artifacts (requirements, architecture, test plans, deployment runbooks)
   - Maintain traceability from requirements → code → tests → deployment

3. **Enterprise Adoption Workflow**:
   - Deploy SDLC framework to projects requiring compliance
   - Generate complete artifact trail (intake → requirements → architecture → testing → deployment)
   - Use multi-agent workflows for comprehensive review (primary author → parallel reviewers → synthesizer)
   - Validate phase gate criteria before transitions
   - Maintain audit trail via Git commit history of `.aiwg/` artifacts

## 4 Product Overview

### 4.1 Product Perspective

The AI Writing Guide exists as a **meta-framework** for AI-assisted work, positioned at the intersection of three domains:

1. **Content Quality**: Fills the gap between generic writing guides and AI-specific detection/authenticity concerns
2. **SDLC Process**: Bridges the disconnect between chat-based agentic coding and structured artifact generation
3. **Enterprise Compliance**: Provides the missing traceability layer for AI-assisted development in regulated environments

```

**Major Interfaces**:

- **User → Framework**: One-line bash install, `aiwg` CLI commands, natural language orchestration via Claude Code
- **Framework → LLM Platforms**: Claude Code (primary), OpenAI/Codex (multi-provider support)
- **Framework → Projects**: Agent deployment (`.claude/agents/`), command deployment (`.claude/commands/`), template copying (`.aiwg/intake/`)
- **Framework → Git**: Version control of artifacts, CI/CD via GitHub Actions, community contributions via PRs

### 4.2 Assumptions and Dependencies

**Assumptions**:

1. **User Workflow Correctness**: Current workflows (intake → inception → elaboration → construction → transition) are fundamentally sound
   - **Validation Trigger**: User testing with 2-5 early adopters reveals major friction points
   - **Pivot Strategy**: If workflows are wrong, iterate based on feedback (ship-now mindset allows rapid adjustment)

2. **Performance at Scale**: Framework remains performant as usage grows from 0 → 10 → 100+ users
   - **Validation Trigger**: Performance degradation reports, support capacity overwhelmed
   - **Mitigation**: Modular deployment (users load subsets), context-optimized documents, self-service infrastructure

3. **GitHub as Distribution**: GitHub repository remains primary distribution channel
   - **Dependency**: GitHub platform availability and policies
   - **Fallback**: Framework is portable (can mirror to GitLab, self-hosted Git if needed)

4. **Node.js Availability**: Users have Node.js >=18.20.8 available for tooling scripts
   - **Dependency**: Node.js runtime
   - **Mitigation**: Minimal Node.js usage (22 scripts), fallback to manual template copying if unavailable

5. **Community Engagement**: Early adopters will provide feedback, report issues, contribute improvements
   - **Validation Trigger**: GitHub stars, issue activity, contributor growth indicate engagement
   - **Risk**: Zero adoption means solo-developer-only tool (acceptable outcome, but limits impact)

6. **Self-Improvement Loop Viability**: Framework can successfully maintain and evolve itself using its own SDLC tools
   - **Current Status**: Early/experimental stage (this intake is part of self-application testing)
   - **Success Criteria**: Framework artifacts (requirements, architecture, tests) improve development velocity and quality

**Dependencies**:

1. **Platform Dependencies**:
   - GitHub (repository hosting, CI/CD, issue tracking)
   - Node.js >=18.20.8 (for tooling scripts)
   - Bash (for install script)
   - Git (for version control operations)

2. **LLM Platform Dependencies**:
   - Claude Code (primary target platform)
   - OpenAI/Codex (secondary platform, multi-provider support)

<!-- PRODUCT-STRATEGIST: Multi-platform ROI unclear. Recommend validation experiment in Phase 1: deploy OpenAI version, track adoption split. Decision threshold: if <10% users request OpenAI in first 3 months, deprioritize; if 20%+ request, invest in abstraction. Avoids premature optimization. -->

3. **Regulatory/Compliance Dependencies**:
   - MIT License compliance (permissive, attribution required)
   - No external compliance frameworks currently (GDPR/PCI-DSS/HIPAA handled by users, not framework itself)

4. **Community Dependencies**:
   - Contributor availability (planning 2-3 within 6 months)
   - Maintainer capacity (solo developer currently, limited support bandwidth)

### 4.4 Alternatives and Competition

| Alternative | Strengths | Weaknesses | Differentiation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Generic Writing Guides** (Strunk & White, technical writing guides) | Timeless principles, broad applicability | Not AI-specific, no detection pattern awareness, no validation tools | AIWG targets AI-generated content explicitly with detection markers, banned phrases, and agent-based validation |
| **AI Detection Tools** (GPTZero, Originality.ai) | Identify AI content | Reactive (detect only, no prevention), no guidance for authentic rewriting | AIWG is preventive (guidelines to avoid patterns), includes rewriting examples maintaining sophistication |
| **Fragmented SDLC Templates** (GitHub template repos, Atlassian templates) | Available for free, cover specific artifacts | Disconnected (no lifecycle integration), no multi-agent orchestration, no LLM platform integration | AIWG provides end-to-end lifecycle (Inception → Production), 58 specialized agents, natural language orchestration, LLM-first design |
| **Enterprise SDLC Tools** (Jira, Azure DevOps, Atlassian suite) | Mature, integrated, team collaboration features | Expensive, heavyweight, not designed for agentic/AI-assisted workflows | AIWG is free, lightweight (documentation-based), optimized for AI agent consumption, supports solo → enterprise scale |
| **Claude Code Docs** (official Anthropic documentation) | Authoritative, platform-specific | Limited SDLC guidance, no comprehensive templates, no writing validation | AIWG extends Claude Code with comprehensive SDLC framework and writing quality layer |
| **DIY Chat Logs** (developers using Claude/GPT without structure) | Flexible, no setup required | Hard to process, no traceability, no artifact structure, poor compliance support | AIWG converts chat-based workflows to structured artifacts with full traceability |

<!-- PRODUCT-STRATEGIST: Missing competitive response analysis. Recommend adding to Appendix A: What if Claude Code/OpenAI/Cursor launch native SDLC features (Medium likelihood, High impact, 12-18 month timeframe)? Mitigation: Differentiate on comprehensiveness (156 templates vs basic), specialization (writing + SDLC), community customization (fork/extend vs platform lock-in). -->

**Competitive Advantages**:

1. **Dual-Purpose Framework**: Only solution combining writing quality validation with comprehensive SDLC toolkit
2. **LLM-First Design**: Optimized for agent consumption (context-optimized docs, natural language orchestration)
3. **Multi-Agent Orchestration**: Built-in patterns for collaborative artifact generation (primary author → reviewers → synthesizer)
4. **Modular Deployment**: Users choose general writing tools, SDLC framework, or both (avoids overwhelming context)
5. **Zero Budget**: Free, open source (MIT license), community-driven
6. **Ship-Now Mindset**: Rapid iteration based on feedback, not waterfall planning
7. **Self-Application**: Framework maintains itself using its own tools (validates practicality)

**Market Positioning**: AIWG targets the underserved niche of **AI-assisted workers needing structure without enterprise overhead**. It's more comprehensive than generic writing guides, more integrated than fragmented SDLC templates, and more accessible than enterprise tools.

## 7 Constraints and Trade-offs

### 7.1 Resource Constraints

**Current**:
- **Team**: Solo developer (1 active contributor)
- **Budget**: Zero (volunteer time, free infrastructure)
- **Time**: ~35 commits/month (~1+ per day), sustainable at <10 hours/week

**Trade-offs Accepted**:
- **Testing**: Manual testing, 30-50% coverage acceptable short-term (will add comprehensive tests post-user-validation)
- **Refactoring**: Prioritize features over code quality short-term (technical debt acceptable, will clean up post-validation)
- **Documentation**: Core usage covered, beginner-friendly paths added reactively based on user feedback

<!-- PRODUCT-STRATEGIST: CRITICAL ISSUE - Zero-budget sustainability model lacks explicit scenarios. Recommend adding:

**Sustainability Scenarios**:

**Scenario 1: Personal Tool Path (0-10 users)**
- Volunteer time sustainable at <5 hours/week
- No community support burden
- Clear communication: framework available as-is, no support commitments
- Acceptable outcome (validates personal workflow)

**Scenario 2: Community Path (10-100 users)**
- Self-service infrastructure reduces support to <10 hours/week
- Contributor growth (2-3 regulars) shares maintenance burden
- GitHub Sponsors or OpenCollective for optional funding (server costs, contributor recognition)
- Trigger: If support >15 hours/week for 2+ months, implement community infrastructure OR reduce scope

**Scenario 3: Commercial Path (100+ users, enterprise traction)**
- Paid support tiers (consulting, custom features, SLAs)
- Dual-license model (MIT for community, commercial for enterprises requiring support contracts)
- Revenue funds maintainer time, infrastructure scaling
- Trigger: If 5+ enterprises request paid support OR maintainer time >20 hours/week unsustainable

This addresses long-term viability regardless of adoption trajectory. -->

### 7.2 Scope Constraints

**In Scope**:
- Writing quality validation (AI detection patterns, authenticity markers)
- SDLC framework (Inception → Transition phases)
- Multi-agent orchestration patterns
- Deployment automation (agents, commands, templates)
- Git-based artifact storage and traceability

**Out of Scope** (at least for v1.0):
- Hosted SaaS version (framework is self-hosted, Git-based)
- Paid features or monetization (MIT license, community-driven)
- Real-time collaboration (async Git-based workflows only)
- Custom LLM training or fine-tuning (framework uses existing LLMs)
- Automated code generation beyond templates (agents guide humans, don't replace them)

### 7.3 Philosophical Constraints

**Ship-Now Mindset**:
- Iterate based on feedback (not waterfall planning)
- Accept imperfection (30-50% test coverage, technical debt acceptable short-term)
- Validate assumptions with real users (2-5 early adopters) before broader launch

**Modular by Design**:
- Users load subsets for project type (general writing, SDLC, or both)
- Avoid overwhelming context (context-optimized documents, selective deployment)
- Support solo → enterprise scale (same framework, different usage patterns)

**Self-Application First**:
- Framework maintains itself using its own tools (validates practicality)
- Dogfooding reveals friction points early (improves user experience)
- Meta-validation (if framework can't improve framework, it needs work)

### A. Risk Register (High-Level)

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Zero adoption post-launch** | Medium | Medium | Accept as solo-developer tool, continue iterating based on own usage |
| **Wrong workflows** (user testing reveals fundamental issues) | Low | High | Pivot based on feedback (ship-now mindset allows rapid adjustment) |
| **Support capacity overwhelmed** | Medium | High | Self-service infrastructure (FAQs, discussions, PR patterns) |
| **Performance issues at scale** | Low | Medium | Modular deployment, context optimization, triggered optimization |
| **Claude Code platform changes** | Low | High | Multi-platform support (OpenAI/Codex fallback), portable framework design |
| **Contributor attrition** | Medium | Medium | Comprehensive onboarding docs (CLAUDE.md, CONTRIBUTING.md), welcoming community culture |

<!-- PRODUCT-STRATEGIST: Pivot triggers too vague. Recommend adding explicit decision criteria to risk register:

**Pivot Trigger #1: Wrong Workflows**
- Signal: 3+ users (out of first 5) report "workflows confusing" or "counter to how I work"
- Action: Pause features, conduct user interviews, prototype alternative
- Timeline: Decide within 2 weeks of trigger

**Pivot Trigger #2: No Adoption**
- Signal: <5 stars after 3 months AND <2 active users AND <3 issues/PRs
- Action: Evaluate marketing/messaging, simplify onboarding, or accept personal-tool path
- Timeline: Decide by end of month 4

**Pivot Trigger #3: Support Overload**
- Signal: Maintainer time >15 hours/week for 4+ consecutive weeks
- Action: Implement self-service OR reduce scope OR transition to commercial
- Timeline: Implement mitigation within 2 weeks

**Pivot Trigger #4: Platform Risk**
- Signal: Claude Code deprecates agents OR OpenAI becomes 40%+ of requests
- Action: Accelerate multi-platform abstraction OR migrate to dominant platform
- Timeline: Platform decision within 1 month

This makes pivot decisions actionable with clear thresholds. -->

### B. Market Analysis (Lightweight)

**Target Market Size**:
- **AI Users** (writers, content creators): Millions globally using ChatGPT, Claude, other LLMs for writing
- **Agentic Developers**: Tens of thousands using Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, other AI coding assistants
- **Enterprise Teams**: Thousands of organizations exploring AI-assisted development with compliance needs

**Addressable Market** (realistic for open source project):
- **Optimistic**: 1000+ active users within 12 months (GitHub stars, regular usage)
- **Realistic**: 100+ active users within 12 months (early adopters, niche audience)
- **Pessimistic**: <10 active users (solo-developer tool, limited appeal)

**Market Validation Triggers**:
- **Proceed**: 50+ GitHub stars within 3 months, 5+ active issues/PRs per month
- **Reassess**: <10 stars after 3 months, zero community engagement
- **Pivot**: User testing reveals fundamental workflow issues, negative feedback

```

**Strategic Position**: AIWG occupies the "Free + Lightweight + Structured" quadrant, targeting users who need more than DIY chat logs but less than enterprise overhead.

### D. Technical Architecture Notes

**Key Design Decisions**:

1. **Documentation-First**: Framework is 485+ markdown files (not code-heavy SaaS)
   - **Rationale**: LLMs consume documentation naturally, low maintenance burden, version-control-friendly
   - **Trade-off**: Less interactive than SaaS, requires LLM platform to be useful

2. **Multi-Agent Orchestration**: Primary Author → Parallel Reviewers → Synthesizer → Archive
   - **Rationale**: Mirrors human collaboration patterns, comprehensive validation, reduces solo-developer bias
   - **Trade-off**: Slower than single-agent generation, requires coordination overhead

3. **`.aiwg/` Artifacts Directory**: All SDLC artifacts stored in structured directory (not project root)
   - **Rationale**: Clean separation (user code vs process artifacts), easy to ignore (.gitignore), discoverable
   - **Trade-off**: Adds directory structure, users must learn new convention

4. **Natural Language Orchestration**: Users trigger flows via phrases ("transition to Elaboration") not slash commands
   - **Rationale**: More intuitive, reduces cognitive load, leverages LLM natural language understanding
   - **Trade-off**: Requires translation layer (70+ phrases mapped to flows), ambiguity potential

### E. Future Considerations (Beyond v1.0)

**If Adoption Grows (100+ Active Users)**:
- Community infrastructure (FAQs, discussions, PR review process)
- Contributor onboarding automation (welcome bots, starter issue labels)
- Advanced multi-platform abstraction (Cursor, Codex, other LLMs)
- Performance optimization (caching, incremental processing)

**If Adoption Stays Small (<10 Active Users)**:
- Continue as solo-developer tool (acceptable outcome, validates personal workflow)
- Reduce maintenance burden (archive less-used features, focus on core)
- Consider merging with complementary projects (if strategic fit emerges)

**If Pivot Required (User Testing Reveals Fundamental Issues)**:
- Re-evaluate workflows based on feedback (ship-now mindset allows rapid iteration)
- Simplify or expand scope as needed (modular design supports both directions)
- Transparent communication with community (explain pivot rationale, invite input)

## Document Status

**Version**: v0.1 (Primary Draft with Product Strategist Comments)
**Author**: System Analyst (Vision Owner role)
**Reviewed By**: Product Strategist
**Date**: 2025-10-17
**Next Steps**:
1. ✓ Review by Product Strategist (CONDITIONAL APPROVAL - revisions needed)
2. Review by Business Process Analyst (validate market positioning, competitive analysis)
3. Review by Requirements Reviewer (verify alignment with intake form, identify gaps)
4. Review by Project Manager (confirm success metrics are measurable, timelines realistic)
5. Synthesize feedback into final vision document
6. Baseline and archive to `.aiwg/requirements/vision.md`

**Outstanding Questions** (from original draft):
1. Are the success metrics (50% user-reported improvement, 100 stars in 6 months) realistic or too aggressive? **PRODUCT-STRATEGIST: Too aggressive - recommend tiered phases (see comments in Section 6)**
2. Should we add more specific technical performance metrics (e.g., agent deployment time <10s)? **PRODUCT-STRATEGIST: Current performance metrics adequate - focus on leading indicators (installs, usage) over technical benchmarks**
3. Is the competitive analysis comprehensive enough, or should we add more alternatives (e.g., Notion templates, Confluence)? **PRODUCT-STRATEGIST: Adequate coverage - missing competitive response plan (see comment in Section 4.4)**
4. Should we include more specific pivot triggers (e.g., "if <5 stars after 1 month, reassess messaging")? **PRODUCT-STRATEGIST: YES - critical gap, see detailed pivot trigger recommendations in Appendix A comment**

**Assumptions Requiring Validation**:
- User workflows (intake → inception → elaboration → construction → transition) are fundamentally sound
- Performance acceptable at scale (framework handles 100+ users without optimization)
- Community engagement will emerge organically (users will report issues, contribute PRs)
- Self-improvement loop is practical (framework can maintain itself using its own tools)

**Product Strategist Recommendations Summary**:
1. **CRITICAL**: Revise Section 6 (Success Metrics) - add tiered phases (0-3mo, 3-6mo, 6-12mo) with leading indicators
2. **CRITICAL**: Expand Section 7.1 (Resource Constraints) - add sustainability scenarios (personal/community/commercial paths)
3. **CRITICAL**: Strengthen Appendix A (Risk Register) - add actionable pivot triggers with specific thresholds
4. **IMPORTANT**: Add competitive response plan to Section 4.4
5. **IMPORTANT**: Add multi-platform validation experiment to Phase 1 (Section 4.2 dependency comment)
6. **MINOR**: Add quantifiable ROI examples to Section 6.1 (mark as hypothesized, to be validated)
