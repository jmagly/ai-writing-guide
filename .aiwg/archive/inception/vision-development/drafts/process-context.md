## Executive Summary

**Overall Assessment**: **STRONG** alignment between current-state problems, future-state vision, and stakeholder needs. The dual-purpose framework (writing quality + SDLC toolkit) addresses clearly articulated pain points with realistic process improvements. All 5 primary personas are well-defined with measurable success criteria.

**Key Strengths**:
- Pain points map directly to real user workflows (AI detection → content validation, chat logs → structured artifacts)
- Process improvements are practical and already validated through self-application (58 agents, 156 templates, 45 commands)
- Stakeholder coverage is comprehensive across individual → enterprise scale
- Self-improvement loop provides meta-validation of framework practicality

**Gaps Identified**:
- **Missing Stakeholder**: Platform vendors (Anthropic/Claude, OpenAI) not explicitly included as stakeholders despite dependency
- **Process Risk**: Self-application still early/experimental (not yet proven at scale)
- **Handoff Clarity**: Multi-agent coordination patterns described but not yet validated with community contributors

**Recommendation**: Proceed with current vision with minor enhancements to address platform vendor coordination and community handoff patterns.

## 1. Current State Problems: Articulation & Workflow Mapping

### 1.1 Problem Articulation Quality

| Problem Dimension | Articulation Quality | Evidence from Documents |
|-------------------|---------------------|-------------------------|
| **AI Detection Patterns** | **Excellent** | Vision explicitly calls out "formulaic patterns," "AI detection rates," "authentic human voice." Intake confirms "485 markdown files" dedicated to pattern identification. |
| **Chat Log Processing** | **Good** | Vision states "hard-to-process chat logs instead of structured artifacts." Intake shows 156 templates as concrete alternative. Minor gap: No quantification of processing time saved. |
| **Missing Audit Trails** | **Good** | Vision mentions "missing compliance/audit trails," ties to enterprise persona needs. Intake shows `.aiwg/` artifact storage + traceability commands. Minor gap: No baseline compliance failure examples. |
| **SDLC Guidance Gap** | **Excellent** | Vision describes "fragmented SDLC templates" vs "comprehensive lifecycle toolkit." Intake shows 58 agents across all phases (Inception → Production). Clear differentiation from competitors. |

**Rating**: 4/5 - Pain points are well-articulated and grounded in real user needs. Minor enhancement: Add 1-2 concrete examples of audit failures or processing bottlenecks to strengthen business case.

### 1.2 Workflow Mapping to Real Users

**Workflow 1: Writing Validation** (AI Users persona)
```
Current State (Pain Point):
User generates content → AI patterns appear → Detection tools flag →
Manual rewrite (trial & error) → No pattern library for reference

Target State (Framework Solution):
User generates content → Load validation docs to context →
Review against banned patterns → Apply rewrite strategies →
Maintain sophistication using examples
```

**Assessment**: Maps correctly to real workflow. Gap: No measurement of time saved (e.g., "reduces rewrite cycles from 3-4 iterations to 1-2").

---

**Workflow 2: Agentic Development** (Agentic Developers persona)
```
Current State (Pain Point):
Chat with AI → Generate code/docs → Save in ad-hoc structure →
Hard to find artifacts → No traceability → Poor handoff to team

Target State (Framework Solution):
Install framework → Deploy agents/commands → Generate intake →
Progress through phases → Structured artifacts in .aiwg/ →
Traceability via commands → Git audit trail
```

**Assessment**: Excellent workflow mapping. Concrete artifacts (`.aiwg/intake/`, `.claude/agents/`) address pain points directly. Minor gap: Handoff between phases not explicitly validated (gate criteria mentioned but not workflow-tested).

---

**Workflow 3: Enterprise Compliance** (Enterprise Teams persona)
```
Current State (Pain Point):
Ad-hoc documentation → Missing artifacts → Audit readiness scramble →
Manual traceability mapping → Compliance gaps discovered late

Target State (Framework Solution):
Full SDLC deployment → Multi-agent artifact generation →
Phase gate validation → Complete artifact trail (.aiwg/ directory) →
Traceability commands (check-traceability) → Git commit audit log
```

**Assessment**: Strong workflow mapping. Gap: No enterprise case studies yet (zero users currently), so workflow is aspirational. Mitigation: Self-application testing provides partial validation.

---

**Rating**: 4.5/5 - Workflows map well to real user needs. Enhancement: Add time/cost savings quantification and validate phase handoff workflows with early adopters.

---

## 2. Desired Future State: Achievability & Process Improvements

### 2.1 Vision Achievability Assessment

| Vision Component | Achievability | Rationale | Risk Mitigation |
|------------------|---------------|-----------|-----------------|
| **Authentic AI writing + structured SDLC** | **High** | Both components already exist (485 docs, 58 agents, 156 templates). Integration proven via self-application (this intake is example). | Risk: Self-application still early/experimental. Mitigation: User testing with 2-5 adopters validates practicality. |
| **Template-based documentation** | **Very High** | 156 templates already created and tested via self-use. Deployment automation working (deploy-agents.mjs). | Risk: Templates may not fit all project types. Mitigation: Option-matrix provides project-specific subsets. |
| **Self-improvement loop** | **Medium** | Currently early/experimental. Intake generated for framework itself, but not yet full lifecycle (no architecture baseline, test plans). | Risk: Framework complexity may exceed agent capacity. Mitigation: Modular deployment prevents context overload. Ship-now mindset allows rapid iteration. |
| **Multi-agent orchestration** | **Medium-High** | Pattern defined (Primary Author → Parallel Reviewers → Synthesizer → Archive). Not yet validated with community contributors (solo developer currently). | Risk: Coordination overhead may slow development. Mitigation: Pattern mirrors human collaboration (familiar to contributors). |
| **Natural language orchestration** | **High** | Translation guide already created (70+ phrases mapped to flows). Core orchestrator role documented in CLAUDE.md. | Risk: Ambiguity in natural language. Mitigation: Translation guide provides explicit mappings. |

**Overall Rating**: 3.8/5 achievability. Vision is realistic with current assets (485 files, 105 commits, working tooling). Primary risk: Self-improvement loop unproven at scale. Mitigation: Ship-now mindset allows iteration based on feedback.

### 2.2 Process Improvement Realism

**Process Improvement 1: Template-Based Documentation**

**Current State**: Ad-hoc artifact creation (chat logs, scattered docs, no standard structure)
**Target State**: 156 templates covering all SDLC phases (intake → requirements → architecture → testing → deployment)
**Realistic?**: **Yes** - Templates exist, deployment automation working, self-application testing provides partial validation.
**Measurable?**: Partially - Can count artifacts generated (intake forms, SAD, ADRs), but no time-saved metrics yet.
**Enhancement**: Add success metric: "Users report 30% reduction in artifact creation time within 3 months" (vs current aspirational "50% report improved authenticity").

---

**Process Improvement 2: Multi-Agent Artifact Generation**

**Current State**: Solo developer writes all documents (single perspective, potential bias)
**Target State**: Primary Author → Parallel Reviewers (security, test, requirements, technical writing) → Synthesizer → Baseline
**Realistic?**: **Mostly** - Pattern is sound (mirrors human collaboration), but not yet tested with real contributors (solo developer currently).
**Measurable?**: Partially - Can track review cycles, but no quality improvement metrics.
**Risk**: Coordination overhead may slow development vs solo writing. Mitigation: For small teams, parallel review is optional (can deploy general writing tools only).
**Enhancement**: Add success metric: "Artifacts with multi-agent review have 50% fewer post-baseline corrections" (validate review pattern effectiveness).

---

**Process Improvement 3: Self-Improvement Loop**

**Current State**: Framework developed ad-hoc (rapid prototyping, manual testing, no structured process)
**Target State**: Framework maintains itself using its own SDLC tools (intake → requirements → architecture → testing → deployment)
**Realistic?**: **Conditional** - Currently early/experimental (intake generated, but no architecture baseline or test plans yet). Depends on framework capacity to handle its own complexity.
**Measurable?**: Yes - Vision includes metric: "100% of new features have corresponding SDLC artifacts within 9 months."
**Risk**: Framework complexity may exceed agent context capacity (485 files, 58 agents). Mitigation: Modular deployment, context-optimized documents.
**Enhancement**: Add intermediate milestone: "50% of new features have SDLC artifacts within 3 months" (phased adoption, not all-or-nothing).

---

**Process Improvement 4: Modular Deployment**

**Current State**: Users deploy entire framework (overwhelming context, irrelevant docs)
**Target State**: Users choose subsets (general writing, SDLC only, or both) via `aiwg -deploy-agents --mode general|sdlc|both`
**Realistic?**: **Yes** - Already implemented (deploy-agents.mjs supports mode parameter). Option-matrix provides project-type-specific recommendations.
**Measurable?**: Yes - Can track deployment mode distribution (via user surveys).
**Enhancement**: Add success metric: "70% of users deploy appropriate subset vs full framework" (validates modular design).

---

**Rating**: 4/5 - Process improvements are realistic and largely validated. Enhancement: Add more granular metrics for time savings, quality improvements, and phased self-application milestones.

---

## 3. Stakeholder Impacts: Coverage & Success Criteria

### 3.1 Stakeholder Coverage Matrix

| Persona | Needs Addressed | Success Criteria Defined? | Impact Clarity | Gaps Identified |
|---------|----------------|--------------------------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Solo Developer** (Joseph Magly) | Strategic direction, maintainer capacity, community building | ✅ Yes - <10 hours/week maintenance, 2-3 contributors within 6 months | ✅ Clear - Role transitions from solo → maintainer → community lead | None |
| **AI Users** | Avoid detection, maintain sophistication, validate content | ✅ Yes - 50% report improved authenticity within 3 months | ✅ Clear - Writing validation workflow, banned patterns documentation | Minor: No time-saved metrics |
| **Agentic Developers** | SDLC structure, artifact generation, traceability | ✅ Yes - 100 GitHub stars in 6 months, 50+ projects with .aiwg/ artifacts | ✅ Clear - Deployment automation, phase workflows, natural language orchestration | Minor: Handoff patterns untested |
| **Enterprise Teams** | Compliance trails, audit support, gate validation | ✅ Yes - Meet SOC2/HIPAA/PCI-DSS requirements via artifact trail | ✅ Clear - Traceability commands, gate checks, handoff checklists | **Gap**: No enterprise case studies (zero users) |
| **Small Teams** | Lightweight workflows, shared documentation, coordination | ✅ Yes - Balanced adoption across small/team/enterprise categories | ✅ Clear - Modular deployment, team profile management, cross-team sync | Minor: Multi-contributor testing pending |
| **Future Contributors** | Onboarding, code review, feature development | ✅ Yes - 2-3 regular contributors within 6 months | ✅ Clear - CLAUDE.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, comprehensive documentation | **Gap**: Onboarding automation not yet built |
| **GitHub Community** | Bug reporting, feature suggestions, contributions | ✅ Yes - 10+ active issues/PRs per month | ✅ Clear - GitHub issue tracking, community infrastructure planned | **Gap**: Self-service infrastructure (FAQs) not yet built |

**Coverage Rating**: 4.5/5 - All 7 identified stakeholders have clear needs and success criteria. Minor gaps in enterprise validation and contributor onboarding automation.

### 3.2 Missing Stakeholder Analysis

**Missing Stakeholder 1: Platform Vendors** (Anthropic/Claude, OpenAI)

**Why Missing?**: Vision treats platforms as dependencies, not stakeholders.
**Impact if Ignored**: Platform changes (API deprecation, agent format changes, pricing) could break framework.
**Recommended Action**: Add "Platform Vendors" stakeholder:
- **Needs**: Stable API usage, community feedback, showcase projects
- **Responsibilities**: Monitor platform changes, adapt to API updates, contribute feedback
- **Success Criteria**: Framework supports 2+ platforms (Claude, OpenAI), adapts to breaking changes within 1 month

---

**Missing Stakeholder 2: Enterprise Compliance Officers** (subset of Enterprise Teams, but distinct needs)

**Why Potentially Missing?**: Grouped under "Enterprise Teams" but have specialized needs (audit prep, regulatory mapping, evidence collection).
**Impact if Ignored**: Framework may not meet specific compliance validation workflows (e.g., SOC2 auditor walkthroughs).
**Recommended Action**: Consider splitting "Enterprise Teams" into:
- **Enterprise Developers** (current focus): Artifact generation, traceability
- **Compliance Officers**: Audit preparation, evidence collection, regulatory mapping

**Optional Enhancement** (low priority): Add explicit compliance persona if enterprise adoption grows.

---

**Rating**: 4/5 - Stakeholder coverage is comprehensive. Enhancement: Add platform vendors as explicit stakeholder with monitoring responsibilities.

### 3.3 Success Criteria Clarity

**Success Criteria Strength Assessment**:

| Persona | Success Criteria | Measurable? | Realistic? | Time-Bound? | Gap |
|---------|-----------------|-------------|-----------|-------------|-----|
| **Solo Developer** | <10 hours/week maintenance | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ❌ No (ongoing) | Add: "Achieved by 6 months post-launch" |
| **AI Users** | 50% report improved authenticity | ✅ Yes (surveys) | ⚠️ Uncertain (no baseline) | ✅ Yes (3 months) | Add baseline: "Users report 3-4 rewrites currently, reduce to 1-2" |
| **Agentic Developers** | 100 stars in 6 months | ✅ Yes (GitHub metrics) | ⚠️ Aggressive (zero users currently) | ✅ Yes (6 months) | Add fallback: "50 stars = moderate success, 10 stars = niche tool" |
| **Enterprise Teams** | Meet SOC2/HIPAA/PCI-DSS | ❌ No (how measured?) | ⚠️ Uncertain (no enterprise users) | ❌ No | Add: "1 enterprise pilot successfully audited within 12 months" |
| **Small Teams** | Balanced adoption distribution | ⚠️ Partially (surveys) | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | Add: "Balanced distribution achieved within 9 months" |
| **Contributors** | 2-3 regular contributors | ✅ Yes (commit history) | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes (6 months) | None - well-defined |
| **Community** | 10+ issues/PRs per month | ✅ Yes (GitHub metrics) | ⚠️ Aggressive | ❌ No | Add: "Achieved by 9 months post-launch" |

**Rating**: 3.5/5 - Success criteria are mostly measurable but several lack time bounds or baseline comparisons. Enhancement: Add time bounds to all criteria and establish baselines for user-reported metrics.

---

## 4. Process Context: Feasibility & Coordination

### 4.1 Self-Application Loop Assessment

**Current State**: Early/experimental (intake generated, vision in progress, no architecture baseline yet)

**Process Flow**:
```
Framework Development Workflow (Target State):
1. Feature idea → intake-wizard (document problem/solution)
2. Vision/requirements → requirements-analyst + system-analyst
3. Architecture → architecture-designer (SAD, ADRs)
4. Implementation → code-reviewer + test-engineer
5. Deployment → devops-engineer (release automation)
6. Monitoring → incident-responder (GitHub issue triage)
```

**Feasibility Analysis**:

| Process Step | Currently Working? | Evidence | Blocker/Risk |
|--------------|-------------------|----------|--------------|
| **Intake** | ✅ Yes | This intake form is example (generated via intake-from-codebase) | None |
| **Vision/Requirements** | ⏳ In Progress | Vision draft v0.1 generated, awaiting review cycles | Risk: Multi-agent review pattern untested with real contributors |
| **Architecture** | ❌ Not Yet | No Software Architecture Document (SAD) or ADRs for framework itself | Blocker: Need architecture-designer to generate SAD baseline |
| **Implementation** | ✅ Partially | 105 commits show development velocity, but no structured code review process | Gap: code-reviewer agent exists but not used (solo developer self-review) |
| **Testing** | ❌ Minimal | Manual testing only, no automated test suite | Blocker: Accepting 30-50% coverage short-term, will add post-validation |
| **Deployment** | ✅ Yes | aiwg CLI installer working, auto-update on every invocation | None |
| **Monitoring** | ✅ Partially | GitHub issues for user reports, but no structured incident triage | Gap: incident-responder agent exists but no production incidents yet (zero users) |

**Rating**: 2.5/5 feasibility currently - Self-application is working for intake/deployment but not yet architecture/testing. Expected to improve as framework matures (ship-now mindset allows iteration).

**Recommendation**:
- **Short-term** (1-2 months): Complete vision → architecture → requirements baseline for framework itself
- **Medium-term** (3-6 months): Add automated testing for tooling scripts (deploy-agents, linting)
- **Long-term** (9-12 months): Full self-application (100% of new features have SDLC artifacts)

### 4.2 Modular Deployment Practicality

**Deployment Modes**:
1. **General Writing Tools Only**: 3 writing agents + validation docs (lightweight, ~50 files)
2. **SDLC Framework Only**: 58 agents + 45 commands + 156 templates (comprehensive, ~400 files)
3. **Both**: Full framework (485 files)

**Practicality Assessment**:

| Mode | Use Case | Context Load | Practicality | Evidence |
|------|----------|--------------|--------------|----------|
| **General Only** | Solo writer, content creator, no software development | Low (~50 docs) | ✅ High | deploy-agents.mjs supports `--mode general` |
| **SDLC Only** | Agentic developer, no writing quality focus | High (~400 docs) | ✅ High | deploy-agents.mjs supports `--mode sdlc` |
| **Both** | Full framework usage (rare, enterprise teams with compliance) | Very High (485 docs) | ⚠️ Medium | Risk: Context overload for small teams. Mitigation: Option-matrix recommends project-specific subsets. |

**Rating**: 4/5 practicality - Modular deployment is working and validated via deployment script. Enhancement: Add usage analytics to track which modes are most common (validate design assumptions).

### 4.3 Handoff/Coordination Patterns

**Multi-Agent Coordination Pattern** (from vision + CLAUDE.md):
```
Primary Author → Parallel Reviewers → Synthesizer → Archive

Example (Architecture Document):
1. Architecture-Designer creates SAD draft → .aiwg/working/architecture/sad/drafts/v0.1-primary-draft.md
2. Parallel launch (single message, 4 Task calls):
   - Security-Architect → security validation
   - Test-Architect → testability review
   - Requirements-Analyst → requirements traceability
   - Technical-Writer → clarity and consistency
3. Documentation-Synthesizer merges feedback → .aiwg/architecture/software-architecture-doc.md (BASELINED)
4. Archive to Git (commit with traceability references)
```

**Coordination Clarity Assessment**:

| Handoff Point | Clarity | Evidence | Gap/Risk |
|--------------|---------|----------|----------|
| **Primary Author → Reviewers** | ✅ Clear | CLAUDE.md orchestration section documents pattern, vision describes workflow | None |
| **Parallel Review Launch** | ✅ Clear | CLAUDE.md specifies "single message with multiple Task calls" | Risk: Untested with real contributors (solo developer currently) |
| **Reviewers → Synthesizer** | ⚠️ Partially Clear | Pattern documented, but no examples of actual review cycles | Gap: Need real multi-agent workflow execution to validate |
| **Synthesizer → Archive** | ✅ Clear | Archive location documented (`.aiwg/architecture/`), Git commit process clear | None |
| **Phase Transitions** | ⚠️ Partially Clear | Gate criteria mentioned (flow-gate-check), but handoff checklists not yet used | Gap: flow-handoff-checklist command exists but not tested |

**Rating**: 3.5/5 clarity - Coordination patterns are documented but not yet validated with community contributors. Enhancement: Run multi-agent workflow for vision review to test pattern in practice.

### 4.4 Inter-Persona Handoffs

**Handoff 1: Solo Developer → Future Contributors**

**Handoff Artifacts**: CLAUDE.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, USAGE_GUIDE.md, per-directory READMEs
**Clarity**: ✅ Excellent - Comprehensive onboarding documentation exists
**Gap**: Onboarding automation not yet built (welcome bots, starter issue labels)
**Risk**: Low - Manual onboarding acceptable for 2-3 contributors (current target)

---

**Handoff 2: AI Users → Agentic Developers** (same user, different context)

**Handoff Artifacts**: USAGE_GUIDE.md (context selection strategy), CLAUDE.md (orchestration guide)
**Clarity**: ✅ Good - Clear distinction between writing validation and SDLC workflows
**Gap**: No examples of users using both workflows simultaneously (uncommon use case)
**Risk**: Low - Modular deployment prevents context confusion

---

**Handoff 3: Agentic Developers → Enterprise Teams** (small team scaling up)

**Handoff Artifacts**: Option-matrix (project-type handling), team profile management (prefill-cards.mjs)
**Clarity**: ⚠️ Moderate - Team profile management exists, but no enterprise case studies yet
**Gap**: No documented scaling playbook (small team → enterprise adoption)
**Risk**: Medium - Enterprise adoption may require features not yet built (e.g., centralized artifact repositories)

---

**Rating**: 3.5/5 - Inter-persona handoffs are mostly clear for solo → small team transition, but enterprise scaling is aspirational (zero enterprise users currently).

---

## 5. Summary: Strengths, Gaps, Recommendations

### 5.1 Strengths

1. **Pain Points Well-Articulated**: AI detection, chat logs, missing audit trails all map to real user workflows with concrete solutions (templates, agents, traceability commands).

2. **Comprehensive Stakeholder Coverage**: All 7 personas have clear needs, responsibilities, and success criteria. Balance across individual → enterprise scale.

3. **Process Improvements Realistic**: Template-based docs, multi-agent orchestration, modular deployment all validated through self-application (early stage but working).

4. **Self-Application Provides Meta-Validation**: Framework maintaining itself using its own tools demonstrates practicality (though still early/experimental).

5. **Modular Deployment Proven**: General/SDLC/both modes working, option-matrix provides project-specific guidance.

6. **Clear Vision-to-Workflow Mapping**: Each persona has explicit workflows (writing validation, agentic development, enterprise compliance) with target states.

### 5.2 Gaps Identified

**Gap 1: Missing Platform Vendor Stakeholder**
- **Impact**: Medium - Platform changes could break framework
- **Recommendation**: Add "Platform Vendors" stakeholder with monitoring responsibilities
- **Owner**: Solo Developer (Joseph Magly)

**Gap 2: Success Criteria Lack Baselines and Time Bounds**
- **Impact**: Medium - Hard to measure progress without baselines ("50% improved authenticity" - compared to what?)
- **Recommendation**: Add baselines ("Users report 3-4 rewrites currently, reduce to 1-2") and time bounds to all criteria
- **Owner**: System Analyst (during requirements refinement)

**Gap 3: Multi-Agent Coordination Untested**
- **Impact**: High - Core process improvement not yet validated with real contributors
- **Recommendation**: Run multi-agent workflow for vision review (this document) to test pattern in practice
- **Owner**: Solo Developer + Future Contributors (when onboarded)

**Gap 4: Self-Application Still Early/Experimental**
- **Impact**: Medium - Framework complexity may exceed agent capacity
- **Recommendation**: Add phased milestones ("50% of features have SDLC artifacts within 3 months") instead of all-or-nothing target
- **Owner**: Solo Developer (via self-application testing)

**Gap 5: Enterprise Scaling Playbook Missing**
- **Impact**: Low (currently zero enterprise users) → High (if enterprise adoption grows)
- **Recommendation**: Defer until enterprise pilot identified. If/when needed, create "Small Team → Enterprise Scaling Guide"
- **Owner**: Conditional (community-driven if adoption grows)

**Gap 6: Time-Saved Metrics Missing**
- **Impact**: Medium - Hard to quantify ROI for users ("How much time does framework save?")
- **Recommendation**: Add success metrics: "30% reduction in artifact creation time," "Reduce rewrites from 3-4 → 1-2"
- **Owner**: System Analyst (add to requirements)

### 5.3 Recommendations

**Immediate Actions** (next 1-2 weeks):

1. **Add Platform Vendor Stakeholder** to vision document (Section 3.1)
   - Needs: Stable API usage, community feedback
   - Responsibilities: Monitor platform changes, adapt to API updates
   - Success Criteria: Support 2+ platforms, adapt to breaking changes within 1 month

2. **Add Baselines to Success Metrics** (Section 6):
   - "AI Users: Reduce rewrites from 3-4 → 1-2 (30% time savings)"
   - "Agentic Developers: 50+ projects with .aiwg/ artifacts (vs 0 currently)"
   - "Enterprise Teams: 1 pilot successfully audited within 12 months"

3. **Add Time Bounds to All Criteria**:
   - Solo Developer: <10 hours/week by 6 months post-launch
   - Community: 10+ issues/PRs per month by 9 months post-launch
   - Small Teams: Balanced distribution by 9 months

**Short-Term Actions** (1-2 months):

4. **Test Multi-Agent Coordination** with vision review:
   - Run vision through business-process-analyst → requirements-reviewer → project-manager review cycle
   - Validate parallel review launch pattern (single message, multiple Task calls)
   - Document learnings in process-context.md (this document)

5. **Add Phased Self-Application Milestones**:
   - 3 months: 50% of features have SDLC artifacts
   - 6 months: 75% of features have SDLC artifacts
   - 9 months: 100% of features have SDLC artifacts (full self-application)

6. **Create Enterprise Scaling Tracker**:
   - Monitor adoption distribution (solo/small/enterprise)
   - If enterprise adoption grows >20%, trigger "Scaling Playbook" creation

**Medium-Term Actions** (3-6 months):

7. **Add Time-Saved Metrics** to user surveys:
   - "How many rewrite cycles before framework?" (baseline)
   - "How many rewrite cycles after framework?" (improvement)
   - "Estimated time saved per artifact?" (ROI quantification)

8. **Validate Contributor Onboarding**:
   - Test CLAUDE.md/CONTRIBUTING.md with 2-3 new contributors
   - Identify friction points, improve documentation
   - Add onboarding automation if needed (welcome bots, starter issues)

---

## 6. Process Context Summary

**Stakeholder Coverage**: 4.5/5 - Comprehensive across 7 personas, minor gap in platform vendor coordination

**Process Feasibility**: 3.8/5 - Template-based docs and modular deployment proven, self-application still early/experimental

**Coordination Clarity**: 3.5/5 - Multi-agent patterns documented but not yet validated with community contributors

**Success Criteria**: 3.5/5 - Mostly measurable, but need baselines and time bounds

**Overall Alignment**: 4/5 - Strong alignment between problems, vision, and stakeholders. Vision is achievable with current assets (485 files, 105 commits, working tooling). Primary risk: Self-improvement loop and multi-agent coordination untested at scale. Mitigation: Ship-now mindset allows rapid iteration based on feedback.
