<!-- TECH-WRITER: SUGGESTION - Consider adding Executive Summary here (1 paragraph, <150 words covering problem/solution/success criteria) for stakeholders who need quick overview before diving into full document. -->

## 1 Introduction

The AI Writing Guide is a dual-purpose framework addressing two critical gaps in AI-assisted content creation and software development:

1. **Writing Quality Framework**: Guidelines, validation patterns, and agents to ensure AI-generated content maintains authentic, professional writing standards while avoiding detection patterns.

2. **SDLC Complete Framework**: Comprehensive software development lifecycle toolkit providing 58 specialized agents, 45 slash commands, and 156 templates for managing agentic coding projects from concept through production.

<!-- TECH-WRITER: QUESTION - Agent count clarity needed: Are there 58 SDLC agents + 3 writing agents = 61 total? Or do the 3 writing agents overlap with the 58? This is referenced inconsistently later (line 113 says "58 specialized agents", line 117 says "3 writing agents"). Please clarify total count and breakdown. -->

This vision document establishes the strategic direction for evolving from a solo-developed prototype (485+ files, 105 commits in 3 months) to a community-driven framework supporting individual developers, small teams, and enterprise organizations.

**Document Purpose**: This vision serves as the alignment reference for all stakeholders (current solo developer, planned 2-3 contributors within 6 months, early adopters) to ensure development priorities, feature decisions, and community-building efforts advance the core mission: making AI-assisted work more authentic, structured, and traceable.

## 2 Positioning

### 2.1 Problem Statement

<!-- TECH-WRITER: CRITICAL - This 78-word single sentence is unreadable. Breaking into digestible chunks is essential for stakeholder comprehension. -->

<!-- TECH-WRITER: SUGGESTED REWRITE (preserves all content, improves readability):

**Problem**: AI-generated content exhibits formulaic patterns that trigger detection tools. Agentic coding workflows produce unstructured chat logs instead of traceable artifacts required for compliance.

**Impact**: Writers face authenticity challenges. Developers lack SDLC structure. Enterprise teams cannot maintain audit trails.

**Solution**: Remove AI detection patterns while preserving professional sophistication. Provide comprehensive SDLC templates, agents, and workflows from concept to production with full traceability.

-->

**The problem of AI-generated content exhibiting formulaic patterns and agentic coding workflows lacking structured SDLC guidance** affects **writers, developers, and enterprise teams using AI assistants**, the impact of which is **reduced content authenticity, hard-to-process chat logs instead of structured artifacts, and missing compliance/audit trails**, a successful solution would **remove AI detection patterns while maintaining sophistication, provide comprehensive SDLC templates and agents from concept to production, and enable traceable artifacts that support enterprise compliance needs**.

### 2.2 Product Position Statement

**For writers, agentic developers, and enterprise teams**, who **need to produce authentic AI-assisted content and structured SDLC artifacts with compliance trails**, the **AI Writing Guide** is a **comprehensive documentation framework and agentic toolkit** that **eliminates AI detection patterns while preserving professional sophistication, and provides complete lifecycle support from intake through production deployment**. Unlike **generic writing guides or fragmented SDLC templates**, our product **combines context-optimized validation rules with 58 specialized agents, 45 workflows, and 156 templates in a single modular framework designed specifically for AI-assisted work**.

<!-- TECH-WRITER: CONSISTENCY - This says "58 specialized agents" but earlier referenced both "58 SDLC agents" and "3 writing agents". Please standardize terminology throughout. -->

## 3 Stakeholder Descriptions

### 3.1 Stakeholder Summary

| Name | Description | Responsibilities |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Solo Developer** (Joseph Magly) | Framework creator, maintainer, primary contributor | Strategic direction, core development, community infrastructure, documentation, release management |
| **AI Users** (writers, content creators) | Individuals using AI assistants for writing | Consume writing guidelines, validate content against detection patterns, maintain authentic voice |
| **Agentic Developers** (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex users) | Developers using AI coding assistants for software projects | Deploy SDLC agents/commands, generate requirements/architecture artifacts, maintain traceability |
| **Enterprise Teams** (10+ developers) | Organizations requiring compliance and audit trails | Use full SDLC lifecycle support, maintain artifact traceability, meet compliance requirements (SOC2, HIPAA, PCI-DSS) |
| **Small Teams** (2-5 developers) | Collaborative projects needing shared structure | Deploy lightweight SDLC workflows, coordinate multi-agent artifact generation, maintain shared documentation |
| **Future Contributors** (2-3 within 6 months) | Developers contributing to framework evolution | Code review, feature development, documentation, community support |
| **GitHub Community** | Open source contributors, issue reporters | Report bugs, suggest features, contribute improvements, validate framework through usage |

<!-- TECH-WRITER: QUESTION - Missing stakeholder: End users of software built with this framework? Or is scope intentionally limited to developers/writers using framework (not downstream consumers)? Please clarify if omission is intentional. -->

### 3.2 User Environment

**Operational Context**:

- **Team Size**: Solo developers to enterprise teams (1-50+ developers)
- **Task Cycle Time**: Writing validation (seconds), SDLC artifact generation (minutes to hours), full phase transitions (days to weeks)
- **Environmental Constraints**:
  - Solo developer currently (limited support capacity)
  - Zero budget (volunteer time, free infrastructure)
  - Node.js >=18.20.8 required for tooling
  - GitHub repository as primary distribution channel
- **Platforms**: Claude Code (primary target), OpenAI/Codex (secondary support), Cursor (future consideration)
- **Integrations**: GitHub Actions (CI/CD), Git (version control), LLM chat interfaces (consumption)
- **Business Model**: Open source (MIT license), community-driven, no monetization currently planned

**User Workflows**:

<!-- TECH-WRITER: APPROVED - Clear, well-structured workflows. Numbered lists with parallel structure. -->

1. **Writing Validation Workflow**:
   - User generates content via AI assistant
   - Loads validation documents into context
   - Reviews content against banned patterns
   - Rewrites flagged sections maintaining sophistication

2. **Agentic Development Workflow**:
   - Install framework via one-line bash script (`curl ... | bash`)
   - Deploy agents/commands to project (`.claude/agents/`, `.claude/commands/`)
   - Generate intake forms (`/project:intake-wizard`)
   - Progress through SDLC phases (Inception → Elaboration → Construction → Transition)
   - Generate structured artifacts (requirements, architecture, test plans, deployment runbooks)
   - Maintain traceability from requirements → code → tests → deployment

3. **Enterprise Adoption Workflow**:
   - Deploy SDLC framework to projects requiring compliance
   - Generate complete artifact trail (intake → requirements → architecture → testing → deployment)
   - Use multi-agent workflows for comprehensive review (primary author → parallel reviewers → synthesizer)
   - Validate phase gate criteria before transitions
   - Maintain audit trail via Git commit history of `.aiwg/` artifacts

## 4 Product Overview

### 4.1 Product Perspective

The AI Writing Guide exists as a **meta-framework** for AI-assisted work, positioned at the intersection of three domains:

1. **Content Quality**: Fills the gap between generic writing guides and AI-specific detection/authenticity concerns
2. **SDLC Process**: Bridges the disconnect between chat-based agentic coding and structured artifact generation
3. **Enterprise Compliance**: Provides the missing traceability layer for AI-assisted development in regulated environments

<!-- TECH-WRITER: CONSISTENCY - Diagram shows "58 agents" and "3 writing agents" as separate. Please clarify if total is 61 agents or if 3 writing agents are subset of 58. -->

**Major Interfaces**:

- **User → Framework**: One-line bash install, `aiwg` CLI commands, natural language orchestration via Claude Code
- **Framework → LLM Platforms**: Claude Code (primary), OpenAI/Codex (multi-provider support)
- **Framework → Projects**: Agent deployment (`.claude/agents/`), command deployment (`.claude/commands/`), template copying (`.aiwg/intake/`)
- **Framework → Git**: Version control of artifacts, CI/CD via GitHub Actions, community contributions via PRs

### 4.2 Assumptions and Dependencies

**Assumptions**:

1. **User Workflow Correctness**: Current workflows (intake → inception → elaboration → construction → transition) are fundamentally sound
   - **Validation Trigger**: User testing with 2-5 early adopters reveals major friction points
   - **Pivot Strategy**: If workflows are wrong, iterate based on feedback (ship-now mindset allows rapid adjustment)

2. **Performance at Scale**: Framework remains performant as usage grows from 0 → 10 → 100+ users
   - **Validation Trigger**: Performance degradation reports, support capacity overwhelmed
   - **Mitigation**: Modular deployment (users load subsets), context-optimized documents, self-service infrastructure

<!-- TECH-WRITER: QUESTION - "100+ users" is referenced multiple times. Please define "active user" (installed in last 30 days? generated 1+ artifact? GitHub interaction?). Without definition, metric is unverifiable. -->

3. **GitHub as Distribution**: GitHub repository remains primary distribution channel
   - **Dependency**: GitHub platform availability and policies
   - **Fallback**: Framework is portable (can mirror to GitLab, self-hosted Git if needed)

4. **Node.js Availability**: Users have Node.js >=18.20.8 available for tooling scripts
   - **Dependency**: Node.js runtime
   - **Mitigation**: Minimal Node.js usage (22 scripts), fallback to manual template copying if unavailable

5. **Community Engagement**: Early adopters will provide feedback, report issues, contribute improvements
   - **Validation Trigger**: GitHub stars, issue activity, contributor growth indicate engagement
   - **Risk**: Zero adoption means solo-developer-only tool (acceptable outcome, but limits impact)

<!-- TECH-WRITER: STYLE - "acceptable outcome" repeated 3 times (lines 194, 351, 475). Consider varying language for stronger impact. -->

6. **Self-Improvement Loop Viability**: Framework can successfully maintain and evolve itself using its own SDLC tools
   - **Current Status**: Early/experimental stage (this intake is part of self-application testing)
   - **Success Criteria**: Framework artifacts (requirements, architecture, tests) improve development velocity and quality

**Dependencies**:

<!-- TECH-WRITER: PASSIVE VOICE - Section uses passive constructions. Consider active voice for clarity. Example: "The framework requires GitHub for repository hosting" vs "GitHub (repository hosting...)" -->

1. **Platform Dependencies**:
   - GitHub (repository hosting, CI/CD, issue tracking)
   - Node.js >=18.20.8 (for tooling scripts)
   - Bash (for install script)
   - Git (for version control operations)

2. **LLM Platform Dependencies**:
   - Claude Code (primary target platform)
   - OpenAI/Codex (secondary platform, multi-provider support)

3. **Regulatory/Compliance Dependencies**:
   - MIT License compliance (permissive, attribution required)
   - No external compliance frameworks currently (GDPR/PCI-DSS/HIPAA handled by users, not framework itself)

<!-- TECH-WRITER: CLARITY - "handled by users, not framework itself" is clearer than original phrasing. Consider adopting this style. -->

4. **Community Dependencies**:
   - Contributor availability (planning 2-3 within 6 months)
   - Maintainer capacity (solo developer currently, limited support bandwidth)

<!-- TECH-WRITER: CONSISTENCY - Table claims "45 slash commands" but intake form referenced 42 commands. Please verify source of truth and ensure cross-document consistency. -->

### 4.4 Alternatives and Competition

<!-- TECH-WRITER: APPROVED - Excellent table structure. Clear comparison with meaningful differentiation. -->

| Alternative | Strengths | Weaknesses | Differentiation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Generic Writing Guides** (Strunk & White, technical writing guides) | Timeless principles, broad applicability | Not AI-specific, no detection pattern awareness, no validation tools | AIWG targets AI-generated content explicitly with detection markers, banned phrases, and agent-based validation |
| **AI Detection Tools** (GPTZero, Originality.ai) | Identify AI content | Reactive (detect only, no prevention), no guidance for authentic rewriting | AIWG is preventive (guidelines to avoid patterns), includes rewriting examples maintaining sophistication |
| **Fragmented SDLC Templates** (GitHub template repos, Atlassian templates) | Available for free, cover specific artifacts | Disconnected (no lifecycle integration), no multi-agent orchestration, no LLM platform integration | AIWG provides end-to-end lifecycle (Inception → Production), 58 specialized agents, natural language orchestration, LLM-first design |
| **Enterprise SDLC Tools** (Jira, Azure DevOps, Atlassian suite) | Mature, integrated, team collaboration features | Expensive, heavyweight, not designed for agentic/AI-assisted workflows | AIWG is free, lightweight (documentation-based), optimized for AI agent consumption, supports solo → enterprise scale |
| **Claude Code Docs** (official Anthropic documentation) | Authoritative, platform-specific | Limited SDLC guidance, no comprehensive templates, no writing validation | AIWG extends Claude Code with comprehensive SDLC framework and writing quality layer |
| **DIY Chat Logs** (developers using Claude/GPT without structure) | Flexible, no setup required | Hard to process, no traceability, no artifact structure, poor compliance support | AIWG converts chat-based workflows to structured artifacts with full traceability |

**Competitive Advantages**:

1. **Dual-Purpose Framework**: Only solution combining writing quality validation with comprehensive SDLC toolkit
2. **LLM-First Design**: Optimized for agent consumption (context-optimized docs, natural language orchestration)
3. **Multi-Agent Orchestration**: Built-in patterns for collaborative artifact generation (primary author → reviewers → synthesizer)
4. **Modular Deployment**: Users choose general writing tools, SDLC framework, or both (avoids overwhelming context)
5. **Zero Budget**: Free, open source (MIT license), community-driven
6. **Ship-Now Mindset**: Rapid iteration based on feedback, not waterfall planning
7. **Self-Application**: Framework maintains itself using its own tools (validates practicality)

**Market Positioning**: AIWG targets the underserved niche of **AI-assisted workers needing structure without enterprise overhead**. It's more comprehensive than generic writing guides, more integrated than fragmented SDLC templates, and more accessible than enterprise tools.

## 5 Other Product Requirements

<!-- TECH-WRITER: HEADING - "Other Product Requirements" is too generic. Consider "Technical Requirements and Constraints" or "Non-Functional Requirements" for clarity. -->

### 5.1 Performance Requirements

**Current Performance Targets** (acceptable for pre-launch):

- **Installation**: One-line bash script completes in <60 seconds (even on slow connections)
- **Agent Deployment**: Deploy 58 agents + 45 commands in <10 seconds
- **Linting**: Markdown validation completes in <30 seconds for full repository (485 files)
- **Manifest Generation**: Generate/sync manifests in <15 seconds
- **Documentation Consumption**: Context-optimized documents fit within LLM context windows (agents can read full templates without truncation)

<!-- TECH-WRITER: APPROVED - Specific, measurable targets. Well-defined. -->

**Future Performance Goals** (if scale triggers optimization):

- **Support at 100+ users**: Self-service infrastructure reduces maintainer burden to <5 hours/week
- **Repository size**: Maintain <100MB total (primarily markdown, minimal binary assets)
- **Tool responsiveness**: All CLI commands complete in <30 seconds on standard hardware

### 5.2 Environmental Constraints

**Development Environment**:

- Solo developer (1 active contributor currently)
- Zero budget (volunteer time, free infrastructure)
- GitHub-dependent (repository hosting, CI/CD, issue tracking)

**User Environment**:

- Node.js >=18.20.8 required for tooling (fallback: manual template copying)
- Git required for version control operations
- Bash required for install script (Linux/macOS primary, WSL for Windows)
- LLM platform required (Claude Code primary, OpenAI/Codex secondary)

**Constraints Driving Design Decisions**:

- **Zero budget** → Free hosting (GitHub), no paid services, community-driven support
- **Solo developer** → Ship-now mindset, accept 30-50% test coverage short-term, prioritize features over refactoring
- **Pre-launch** → User testing with 2-5 early adopters validates assumptions before broader release

### 5.3 Documentation Requirements

**Current Documentation** (comprehensive for pre-launch):

- **README.md**: Overview, installation, quick start
- **USAGE_GUIDE.md**: Context selection strategy (critical for avoiding over-inclusion)
- **AGENTS.md**: Contribution guidelines, SDLC overview
- **CLAUDE.md**: Project-specific instructions for Claude Code agents
- **ROADMAP.md**: 12-month development plan
- **PROJECT_SUMMARY.md**: Expansion roadmap, value proposition
- **CONTRIBUTING.md**: Contributor guidelines (planned for team expansion)
- **agentic/code/frameworks/sdlc-complete/README.md**: SDLC framework documentation
- **commands/DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md**: Advanced slash command patterns
- **Per-directory READMEs**: Context-specific guidance

**Future Documentation Needs** (post-launch):

- **FAQs**: Self-service support for common questions
- **Tutorials**: Beginner-friendly paths if user testing reveals clarity gaps
- **API Documentation**: If programmatic access to framework emerges as need
- **Case Studies**: Real-world usage examples from community

### 5.4 Quality Attributes

**Stability**:

- **Current**: Early/experimental (pre-launch, 0 users, accepting breaking changes)
- **Target**: Stable API after v1.0 (semantic versioning, deprecation warnings for breaking changes)
- **Risk**: Solo developer limits testing coverage (mitigated by community testing post-launch)

**Benefit/Value**:

- **Writing Quality**: Measurable via user-reported reduction in AI detection rates
- **SDLC Adoption**: Measurable via GitHub stars, issue activity, contributor growth
- **Self-Improvement Loop**: Measurable via framework artifacts improving development velocity

**Effort/Complexity**:

- **User Effort**: One-line install, single command deployment, natural language orchestration (minimize setup friction)
- **Contributor Effort**: Comprehensive CLAUDE.md/CONTRIBUTING.md reduce onboarding friction
- **Maintenance Effort**: Solo developer sustainable (<10 hours/week) via automation (linting CI/CD, manifest sync)

**Risk**:

- **Adoption Risk**: Zero users post-launch → Continue as solo-developer tool (acceptable, but limits impact)
- **Support Risk**: 100+ users overwhelm solo developer → Community infrastructure (FAQs, discussions, PR patterns)
- **Performance Risk**: Scale issues even at small usage → Optimization triggered by performance reports
- **Platform Risk**: Claude Code discontinues agent support → Multi-platform support mitigates (OpenAI/Codex fallback)

**Red (Requires Pivot/Intervention)**:
- Negative growth (users abandoning framework, public criticism)
- 20+ open critical issues unresolved >1 month
- All contributors inactive for 6+ months
- Support burden >20 hours/week (unsustainable for solo developer)

## 7 Constraints and Trade-offs

### 7.1 Resource Constraints

**Current**:
- **Team**: Solo developer (1 active contributor)
- **Budget**: Zero (volunteer time, free infrastructure)
- **Time**: ~35 commits/month (~1+ per day), sustainable at <10 hours/week

**Trade-offs Accepted**:
- **Testing**: Manual testing, 30-50% coverage acceptable short-term (will add comprehensive tests post-user-validation)
- **Refactoring**: Prioritize features over code quality short-term (technical debt acceptable, will clean up post-validation)
- **Documentation**: Core usage covered, beginner-friendly paths added reactively based on user feedback

### 7.2 Scope Constraints

**In Scope**:
- Writing quality validation (AI detection patterns, authenticity markers)
- SDLC framework (Inception → Transition phases)
- Multi-agent orchestration patterns
- Deployment automation (agents, commands, templates)
- Git-based artifact storage and traceability

**Out of Scope** (at least for v1.0):
- Hosted SaaS version (framework is self-hosted, Git-based)
- Paid features or monetization (MIT license, community-driven)
- Real-time collaboration (async Git-based workflows only)
- Custom LLM training or fine-tuning (framework uses existing LLMs)
- Automated code generation beyond templates (agents guide humans, don't replace them)

### 7.3 Philosophical Constraints

**Ship-Now Mindset**:
- Iterate based on feedback (not waterfall planning)
- Accept imperfection (30-50% test coverage, technical debt acceptable short-term)
- Validate assumptions with real users (2-5 early adopters) before broader launch

**Modular by Design**:
- Users load subsets for project type (general writing, SDLC, or both)
- Avoid overwhelming context (context-optimized documents, selective deployment)
- Support solo → enterprise scale (same framework, different usage patterns)

**Self-Application First**:
- Framework maintains itself using its own tools (validates practicality)
- Dogfooding reveals friction points early (improves user experience)
- Meta-validation (if framework can't improve framework, it needs work)

<!-- TECH-WRITER: CLARITY - "it needs work" - does "it" refer to framework or self-improvement capability? Consider "the framework needs refinement" for clarity. -->

## Appendices

### A. Risk Register (High-Level)

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Zero adoption post-launch** | Medium | Medium | Accept as solo-developer tool, continue iterating based on own usage |
| **Wrong workflows** (user testing reveals fundamental issues) | Low | High | Pivot based on feedback (ship-now mindset allows rapid adjustment) |
| **Support capacity overwhelmed** | Medium | High | Self-service infrastructure (FAQs, discussions, PR patterns) |
| **Performance issues at scale** | Low | Medium | Modular deployment, context optimization, triggered optimization |
| **Claude Code platform changes** | Low | High | Multi-platform support (OpenAI/Codex fallback), portable framework design |
| **Contributor attrition** | Medium | Medium | Comprehensive onboarding docs (CLAUDE.md, CONTRIBUTING.md), welcoming community culture |

### B. Market Analysis (Lightweight)

**Target Market Size**:
- **AI Users** (writers, content creators): Millions globally using ChatGPT, Claude, other LLMs for writing
- **Agentic Developers**: Tens of thousands using Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, other AI coding assistants
- **Enterprise Teams**: Thousands of organizations exploring AI-assisted development with compliance needs

**Addressable Market** (realistic for open source project):
- **Optimistic**: 1000+ active users within 12 months (GitHub stars, regular usage)
- **Realistic**: 100+ active users within 12 months (early adopters, niche audience)
- **Pessimistic**: <10 active users (solo-developer tool, limited appeal)

**Market Validation Triggers**:
- **Proceed**: 50+ GitHub stars within 3 months, 5+ active issues/PRs per month
- **Reassess**: <10 stars after 3 months, zero community engagement
- **Pivot**: User testing reveals fundamental workflow issues, negative feedback

```

**Strategic Position**: AIWG occupies the "Free + Lightweight + Structured" quadrant, targeting users who need more than DIY chat logs but less than enterprise overhead.

### D. Technical Architecture Notes

**Key Design Decisions**:

1. **Documentation-First**: Framework is 485+ markdown files (not code-heavy SaaS)
   - **Rationale**: LLMs consume documentation naturally, low maintenance burden, version-control-friendly
   - **Trade-off**: Less interactive than SaaS, requires LLM platform to be useful

2. **Multi-Agent Orchestration**: Primary Author → Parallel Reviewers → Synthesizer → Archive
   - **Rationale**: Mirrors human collaboration patterns, comprehensive validation, reduces solo-developer bias
   - **Trade-off**: Slower than single-agent generation, requires coordination overhead

3. **`.aiwg/` Artifacts Directory**: All SDLC artifacts stored in structured directory (not project root)
   - **Rationale**: Clean separation (user code vs process artifacts), easy to ignore (.gitignore), discoverable
   - **Trade-off**: Adds directory structure, users must learn new convention

4. **Natural Language Orchestration**: Users trigger flows via phrases ("transition to Elaboration") not slash commands
   - **Rationale**: More intuitive, reduces cognitive load, leverages LLM natural language understanding
   - **Trade-off**: Requires translation layer (70+ phrases mapped to flows), ambiguity potential

### E. Future Considerations (Beyond v1.0)

**If Adoption Grows (100+ Active Users)**:
- Community infrastructure (FAQs, discussions, PR review process)
- Contributor onboarding automation (welcome bots, starter issue labels)
- Advanced multi-platform abstraction (Cursor, Codex, other LLMs)
- Performance optimization (caching, incremental processing)

**If Adoption Stays Small (<10 Active Users)**:
- Continue as solo-developer tool (acceptable outcome, validates personal workflow)

<!-- TECH-WRITER: STYLE - Third instance of "acceptable outcome" phrase. Consider varying language for stronger writing. -->

- Reduce maintenance burden (archive less-used features, focus on core)
- Consider merging with complementary projects (if strategic fit emerges)

**If Pivot Required (User Testing Reveals Fundamental Issues)**:
- Re-evaluate workflows based on feedback (ship-now mindset allows rapid iteration)
- Simplify or expand scope as needed (modular design supports both directions)
- Transparent communication with community (explain pivot rationale, invite input)

## Document Status

**Version**: v0.1 (Primary Draft)
**Author**: System Analyst (Vision Owner role)
**Date**: 2025-10-17
**Next Steps**:
1. Review by Business Process Analyst (validate market positioning, competitive analysis)
2. Review by Requirements Reviewer (verify alignment with intake form, identify gaps)
3. Review by Project Manager (confirm success metrics are measurable, timelines realistic)
4. Synthesize feedback into final vision document
5. Baseline and archive to `.aiwg/requirements/vision.md`

**Outstanding Questions**:
1. Are the success metrics (50% user-reported improvement, 100 stars in 6 months) realistic or too aggressive?
2. Should we add more specific technical performance metrics (e.g., agent deployment time <10s)?
3. Is the competitive analysis comprehensive enough, or should we add more alternatives (e.g., Notion templates, Confluence)?
4. Should we include more specific pivot triggers (e.g., "if <5 stars after 1 month, reassess messaging")?

**Assumptions Requiring Validation**:
- User workflows (intake → inception → elaboration → construction → transition) are fundamentally sound
- Performance acceptable at scale (framework handles 100+ users without optimization)
- Community engagement will emerge organically (users will report issues, contribute PRs)
- Self-improvement loop is practical (framework can maintain itself using its own tools)
