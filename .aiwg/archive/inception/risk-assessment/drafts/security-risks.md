# Security Risk Assessment - AI Writing Guide

## Document Information

- **Risk Category**: Security & Compliance
- **Assessment Date**: 2025-10-17
- **Assessor**: Security Architect
- **Project Phase**: Pre-launch (Inception)
- **Overall Risk Level**: LOW

## Executive Summary

The AI Writing Guide presents minimal security risks appropriate for an open-source documentation framework. As a public repository with no user data collection, authentication, or regulatory requirements, the primary risks center on supply chain security and contributor access control. All identified risks are LOW severity with straightforward mitigation strategies.

## Risk Assessment

### RISK-SEC-001: Node.js Dependency Vulnerabilities

**Category**: Supply Chain Security
**Likelihood**: MEDIUM
**Impact**: LOW
**Overall Severity**: LOW

**Description**: The 22 Node.js scripts in tools/ may have dependencies with known vulnerabilities that could be exploited if malicious actors gain repository access.

**Current State**:
- No package.json detected (scripts appear dependency-free)
- Manual code review by solo developer
- No automated dependency scanning

**Mitigation Strategy**:
- Add `npm audit` to CI/CD pipeline when dependencies are introduced
- Use GitHub Dependabot for automated vulnerability alerts
- Pin dependency versions to prevent unexpected updates

**Reassessment Triggers**:
- When package.json is added with external dependencies
- Upon reaching 10+ GitHub stars (increased visibility)

### RISK-SEC-002: Installation Script Execution

**Category**: Distribution Security
**Likelihood**: LOW
**Impact**: MEDIUM
**Overall Severity**: LOW

**Description**: The bash installer (`tools/install/install.sh`) runs with user privileges and could theoretically be compromised to execute malicious code.

**Current State**:
- Standard `curl | bash` pattern widely used in open source
- Script is public and reviewable
- No elevated privileges required

**Mitigation Strategy**:
- Document recommendation for users to review script before execution
- Provide checksums for releases (when formal releases begin)
- Consider signed releases if project reaches 100+ users

**Reassessment Triggers**:
- First formal release (v1.0)
- Enterprise adoption inquiries

### RISK-SEC-003: Malicious Contributor Code

**Category**: Access Control
**Likelihood**: LOW (currently)
**Impact**: MEDIUM
**Overall Severity**: LOW

**Description**: As the project grows to 2-3 contributors, malicious code could be introduced through pull requests.

**Current State**:
- Solo developer with full control
- Planning 2-3 contributors within 6 months
- No formal code review process yet

**Mitigation Strategy**:
- Implement PR review requirements before contributor expansion
- Use GitHub branch protection rules (require reviews, no force pushes)
- Add CODEOWNERS file to ensure critical paths reviewed
- Consider security scanning tools (GitHub CodeQL) at 10+ contributors

**Reassessment Triggers**:
- First external contributor added
- Reaching 5+ active contributors
- Any security incident

### RISK-SEC-004: Template Content Injection

**Category**: Content Security
**Likelihood**: VERY LOW
**Impact**: MINIMAL
**Overall Severity**: LOW

**Description**: User-provided content in templates could theoretically contain malicious markdown or scripts, though impact is minimal in static documentation.

**Current State**:
- Templates are static markdown
- No code execution in documentation
- No server-side processing

**Mitigation Strategy**:
- Document best practices for template usage
- Warn against including secrets/credentials in templates
- No technical mitigation needed (risk inherent to documentation)

**Reassessment Triggers**:
- If dynamic template processing is added
- If web-based viewer/renderer is created

### RISK-SEC-005: API Key Exposure in Generated Artifacts

**Category**: Secrets Management
**Likelihood**: LOW
**Impact**: LOW
**Overall Severity**: LOW

**Description**: Users might accidentally commit API keys or credentials in their `.aiwg/` artifacts directory.

**Current State**:
- Framework generates documentation only
- No built-in secret handling
- User responsibility for secrets management

**Mitigation Strategy**:
- Add warnings in documentation about not committing secrets
- Provide .gitignore templates that exclude common secret files
- Consider basic secret scanning in generated content (regex patterns)

**Reassessment Triggers**:
- User reports of exposed secrets
- Enterprise adoption requiring compliance

### RISK-SEC-006: GitHub Platform Dependency

**Category**: Platform Security
**Likelihood**: VERY LOW
**Impact**: HIGH
**Overall Severity**: LOW

**Description**: Complete dependency on GitHub for hosting, distribution, and CI/CD creates single point of failure.

**Current State**:
- Entire project hosted on GitHub
- No mirror repositories
- GitHub has excellent uptime and security track record

**Mitigation Strategy**:
- Document backup/migration procedures
- Consider mirror on GitLab if project reaches 100+ users
- Keep local backups of repository

**Reassessment Triggers**:
- GitHub service degradation affecting users
- Reaching 100+ active users
- GitHub policy changes affecting project

## Risk Summary

| Risk ID | Description | Severity | Action Required |
|---------|-------------|----------|-----------------|
| RISK-SEC-001 | Node.js dependency vulnerabilities | LOW | Monitor when dependencies added |
| RISK-SEC-002 | Installation script execution | LOW | Document review recommendation |
| RISK-SEC-003 | Malicious contributor code | LOW | Add PR protections before team expansion |
| RISK-SEC-004 | Template content injection | LOW | Documentation only |
| RISK-SEC-005 | API key exposure in artifacts | LOW | Add documentation warnings |
| RISK-SEC-006 | GitHub platform dependency | LOW | Monitor, consider mirrors at scale |

## Security Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Before Launch)
1. Add security section to README warning about:
   - Reviewing install script before execution
   - Not committing secrets to `.aiwg/` directories
   - Template content is user responsibility

2. Create SECURITY.md with:
   - Security reporting procedures
   - Supported versions policy
   - Security update process

### Before Team Expansion (2-3 months)
1. Enable GitHub branch protection rules
2. Create CODEOWNERS file
3. Document PR review requirements
4. Add basic CI security checks

### At Scale Triggers (6-12 months, conditional)
1. **At 10+ contributors**: Add automated security scanning (CodeQL)
2. **At 100+ users**: Consider signed releases, mirror repositories
3. **At enterprise adoption**: Formal security audit, SOC2 lite compliance

## Compliance Assessment

**Current Requirements**: NONE

The project has no compliance obligations beyond MIT license attribution requirements:
- No user data collection (GDPR N/A)
- No payment processing (PCI-DSS N/A)
- No health information (HIPAA N/A)
- No authentication/authorization required

**Future Considerations**:
- If enterprise teams adopt the framework, they handle their own compliance using generated artifacts
- The framework provides templates and workflows for compliance documentation but doesn't enforce compliance itself

## Security Posture Evaluation

**Appropriate for Project Type**: âœ“ YES

As an open-source documentation framework with:
- No user data collection
- No authentication systems
- No sensitive operations
- Public repository model
- MIT license

The minimal security posture is entirely appropriate. The identified risks are all LOW severity and have straightforward mitigations that can be implemented as the project grows.

## Next Review

**Scheduled**: Upon first of:
- First external contributor onboarded
- 10+ GitHub stars achieved
- 3 months from assessment date (2025-01-17)
- Any security incident reported

**Document Status**: DRAFT v0.1
**Next Steps**: Review with development team, incorporate into risk register, implement immediate recommendations
