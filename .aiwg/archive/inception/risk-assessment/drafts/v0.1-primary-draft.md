## Detailed Risk Descriptions

### RISK-001: Zero Adoption Post-Launch

**Category**: Business
**Likelihood**: MEDIUM (50% probability - unproven product-market fit, niche audience)
**Impact**: HIGH (project remains solo-developer tool, limited community impact, no validation of assumptions)
**Current Status**: Identified
**Exposure**: HIGH

**Description**:
Framework launches with comprehensive features (58 agents, 45 commands, 156 templates) but attracts zero community adoption. Indicators: <5 GitHub stars after 3 months, <2 active users, <3 issues/PRs filed. This is a valid personal-tool scenario but limits framework validation, community feedback, and broader impact.

**Mitigation Strategy**:
1. Pre-launch user recruitment: Reach out to 5-10 potential early adopters via Reddit (r/ClaudeAI, r/ChatGPT), Discord (Claude/OpenAI communities), GitHub discussions before launch
2. Create launch announcement content: Blog post, demo video (5-10 min walkthrough), before/after examples for writing validation
3. Establish success metrics baseline: Track GitHub clone analytics, star growth rate, issue/PR activity weekly for first 3 months
4. Pivot trigger defined: If <5 stars AND <2 active users AND <3 issues/PRs after 3 months → Accept personal-tool path, reduce scope to sustainable maintenance mode (<5 hours/week)
5. Communication plan: Clear README/CONTRIBUTING.md stating "early stage, solo developer, community-driven" to set expectations

**Triggers** (Risk Materializing):
- 3-month post-launch checkpoint: <5 GitHub stars
- Zero users complete full SDLC cycle (Inception → Elaboration)
- Zero community engagement (issues, PRs, discussions)
- Zero testimonials or user feedback submitted

**Owner**: Solo Developer (Joseph Magly)

**Residual Risk** (After Mitigation): MEDIUM (mitigation reduces likelihood to LOW, but acceptance of personal-tool path is fallback)

---

### RISK-002: Support Capacity Overwhelmed

**Category**: Business
**Likelihood**: MEDIUM (40% probability - depends on adoption curve, self-service infrastructure timing)
**Impact**: HIGH (maintainer burnout, poor user experience, reputation damage, unsustainable workload)
**Current Status**: Identified
**Exposure**: HIGH

**Description**:
Community adoption grows faster than self-service infrastructure can scale. Support burden exceeds 15 hours/week for 4+ consecutive weeks, overwhelming solo developer capacity. Users experience slow issue responses (>2 weeks), unanswered questions, stalled PRs. Framework reputation suffers, early adopters churn.

**Mitigation Strategy**:
1. Implement self-service infrastructure early (within 1-2 months post-launch):
   - FAQ documentation (10-15 common questions)
   - GitHub Discussions for Q&A (searchable, community-driven)
   - Issue templates with troubleshooting checklists
   - Video tutorials for high-friction areas (installation, deployment, first workflow)
2. Set clear support boundaries in CONTRIBUTING.md:
   - Expected issue response time (48-72 hours for critical, 1 week for non-critical)
   - "Best effort" support policy (no SLAs unless commercial transition)
   - Encourage community-to-community support via Discussions
3. Monitor support capacity weekly:
   - Track hours spent on issue triage, PR review, user questions
   - Trigger commercial transition if >15 hours/week sustained for 2+ months
4. Automate where possible:
   - GitHub Actions for automated testing, linting
   - PR acceptance patterns for docs/linting fixes (low-risk automation)
   - Issue triage labels (good first issue, needs reproduction, etc.)

**Triggers** (Risk Materializing):
- Support time exceeds 15 hours/week for 4+ consecutive weeks
- 10+ open critical issues unresolved >2 weeks
- User complaints about slow response times (public criticism on GitHub, Reddit, Discord)
- Maintainer reports burnout symptoms (delayed responses, quality degradation)

**Owner**: Solo Developer (Joseph Magly)

**Residual Risk** (After Mitigation): MEDIUM (self-service infrastructure reduces likelihood, but unpredictable adoption curve remains)

---

### RISK-003: Wrong Value Proposition

**Category**: Business
**Likelihood**: LOW (20% probability - early self-application validates core workflows, but user needs may differ)
**Impact**: HIGH (requires major pivot, delays feature roadmap, user confusion, wasted development effort)
**Current Status**: Identified
**Exposure**: MEDIUM

**Description**:
Users don't need dual writing validation + SDLC framework. They want specialized tools (writing-only OR SDLC-only), not combined offering. Modular deployment mitigates this partially, but if users consistently request separation, framework may need architectural split.

**Mitigation Strategy**:
1. User testing with clear segmentation: Recruit 2 users for writing-only, 2 for SDLC-only, 1 for both
2. Track deployment patterns via surveys: "Which mode did you deploy? (general/SDLC/both)"
3. Measure usage via GitHub search: Public repos using `.claude/agents/writing-validator.md` vs `architecture-designer.md`
4. Pivot trigger: If 80%+ of users deploy single mode AND request complete separation (different repos, different branding) → Consider split
5. Communication: Emphasize modular deployment in README, USAGE_GUIDE.md ("Use what you need, ignore the rest")

**Triggers** (Risk Materializing):
- 80%+ of surveyed users deploy single mode (general XOR SDLC, not both)
- 5+ users request separate repositories (writing guide vs SDLC framework)
- User feedback: "Too much, overwhelming, wish this was two tools"

**Owner**: Solo Developer (Joseph Magly)

**Residual Risk** (After Mitigation): LOW (modular deployment already addresses core concern, split is expensive but feasible)

---

### RISK-004: Solo Developer Burnout

**Category**: Resource
**Likelihood**: MEDIUM (40% probability - 1+ commit/day velocity sustainable short-term, but burnout risk exists)
**Impact**: SHOW STOPPER (project stalls, users abandoned, reputation damage, unsustainable)
**Current Status**: Mitigating
**Exposure**: HIGH

**Description**:
Solo developer maintains 1+ commit/day velocity (35 commits/month) unsustainably. Burnout leads to project abandonment, delayed issue responses, quality degradation, zero contributor onboarding. Framework becomes maintenance-only or archived.

**Mitigation Strategy** (ACTIVE):
1. Velocity throttling (already implementing):
   - Accept 30-50% test coverage short-term (manual testing acceptable)
   - Prioritize features over refactoring (technical debt acceptable until validation)
   - Ship-now mindset (iterate fast, perfect later)
2. Time budgeting (enforce weekly):
   - Cap development at 10 hours/week (2 hours/day, 5 days/week)
   - Reserve 2-3 hours/week for support capacity (issues, PRs, discussions)
   - Zero work on weekends unless critical bug (emergency only)
3. Contributor recruitment (within 6 months):
   - Prepare CONTRIBUTING.md with onboarding guide
   - Label "good first issue" for new contributors (5-10 issues tagged)
   - Use flow-team-onboarding when 2nd contributor joins
4. Personal health checks (monthly):
   - Self-assessment: "Am I enjoying this?" (if NO 2+ months → reduce scope)
   - Velocity review: Is 1+ commit/day sustainable? (if NO → accept slower pace)
   - Burnout signals: Delayed responses, quality issues, resentment

**Triggers** (Risk Materializing):
- Sustained >10 hours/week development for 4+ weeks (exhaustion risk)
- Missed personal commitments due to framework work
- Self-reported burnout symptoms (resentment, quality degradation, delayed responses)
- Zero contributor interest after 6 months (unsustainable solo path)

**Owner**: Solo Developer (Joseph Magly)

**Residual Risk** (After Mitigation): MEDIUM (mitigation strategies active, but personal discipline required)

---

### RISK-005: Contributor Recruitment Fails

**Category**: Resource
**Likelihood**: MEDIUM (50% probability - niche technical project, requires Claude Code expertise, time commitment)
**Impact**: HIGH (solo developer remains bottleneck, limited scaling, support capacity constraints)
**Current Status**: Identified
**Exposure**: HIGH

**Description**:
Framework fails to recruit 2-3 contributors within 6 months. Reasons: Niche audience (Claude Code users), requires LLM expertise, time commitment unclear, onboarding friction, competition for open source contributors. Solo developer remains bottleneck for all development, support, and maintenance.

**Mitigation Strategy**:
1. Lower contributor barriers:
   - Comprehensive CONTRIBUTING.md with step-by-step onboarding
   - Video walkthrough of contribution process (fork, clone, edit, test, PR)
   - Label "good first issue" with detailed descriptions (10-15 issues)
   - Acknowledge all contributions (even small docs fixes) publicly
2. Diverse contribution types:
   - Not just code: Documentation, examples, use cases, bug reports, testing
   - Recognition system: CONTRIBUTORS.md with contributor profiles
   - Low-friction contributions: Typo fixes, markdown improvements, example additions
3. Active recruitment:
   - Reach out to engaged users (issue filers, discussion participants)
   - Highlight collaboration opportunities in README
   - Offer "co-maintainer" role to high-quality contributors
4. Acceptance criteria clarity:
   - Explicit: No maintainer gatekeeping, fast PR turnaround (<48 hours for simple PRs)
   - Use automated PR acceptance for low-risk changes (docs, linting, manifest updates)

**Triggers** (Risk Materializing):
- 6-month checkpoint: Zero contributors with 3+ merged PRs
- Zero contributor recruitment inquiries (no one expresses interest)
- High contributor churn (users submit 1 PR then disappear)
- All "good first issue" labels remain unassigned after 3 months

**Owner**: Solo Developer (Joseph Magly)

**Residual Risk** (After Mitigation): MEDIUM (mitigation improves odds, but external contributor availability unpredictable)

---

### RISK-006: Time Investment Exceeds Value

**Category**: Resource
**Likelihood**: LOW (20% probability - solo developer already using framework for self-hosting, validates personal value)
**Impact**: MEDIUM (project abandoned or reduced to minimal maintenance, opportunity cost for other projects)
**Current Status**: Monitoring
**Exposure**: LOW

**Description**:
Developer realizes framework maintenance (10+ hours/week) exceeds personal benefit or career value. Opportunity cost: Could invest time in higher-impact projects, skill development, or income-generating work. Framework becomes burden rather than asset.

**Mitigation Strategy**:
1. Value validation quarterly:
   - Self-assessment: "Is this framework improving my development velocity?"
   - ROI calculation: Time saved by SDLC structure vs time spent maintaining
   - Career impact: Does framework demonstrate valuable skills (agentic workflows, SDLC expertise)?
2. Pivot options if value insufficient:
   - Reduce scope: Archive less-used features, focus on core (writing OR SDLC, not both)
   - Merge with complementary projects: Partner with other frameworks for shared maintenance
   - Archive project: Clear communication, recommend alternatives, preserve as reference
3. Success indicators (value validated):
   - Framework reduces time to artifact generation (vs manual template copying)
   - Self-application loop improves code quality (requirements → tests → docs traceability)
   - Community recognition (stars, mentions, testimonials) provides career value

**Triggers** (Risk Materializing):
- Quarterly self-assessment: "No" to "Is this valuable?" for 2+ consecutive quarters
- Framework artifacts (requirements, architecture) do not improve development velocity
- Opportunity cost identified: Clear higher-value projects available

**Owner**: Solo Developer (Joseph Magly)

**Residual Risk** (After Mitigation): LOW (self-application already validates personal value, monitoring ensures early detection)

---

### RISK-007: User Testing Recruitment Delayed

**Category**: Schedule
**Likelihood**: MEDIUM (40% probability - niche audience, time commitment required, trust barrier for early adopters)
**Impact**: HIGH (delays validation, extends pre-launch phase, wastes development effort if assumptions wrong)
**Current Status**: Identified
**Exposure**: HIGH

**Description**:
Cannot recruit 2-5 users for testing within 2-4 weeks post-deployment preparation. Reasons: Niche technical audience (Claude Code users), time commitment unclear (how long does testing take?), trust barrier (unproven framework, solo developer), lack of incentives. Validation delayed by weeks or months, increasing risk of wrong assumptions remaining undetected.

**Mitigation Strategy**:
1. Pre-launch recruitment (start now):
   - Reddit outreach: r/ClaudeAI, r/ChatGPT, r/MachineLearning (post framework overview, request testers)
   - Discord communities: Claude, OpenAI, Cursor (participate, share progress, invite testers)
   - GitHub Discussions: Create "Early Adopters" thread, explain testing process, ask for volunteers
2. Reduce testing friction:
   - Clear time commitment: "2-4 hours over 2 weeks" (1 hour initial setup, 1 hour usage, 1-2 hours feedback)
   - Provide test script: Step-by-step guide (install → deploy → generate intake → validate workflows)
   - Offer incentives: Public recognition (CONTRIBUTORS.md), early access to features, co-author acknowledgment
3. Lower trust barriers:
   - Transparent communication: "Early stage, expect bugs, feedback welcome"
   - Video demo: Show framework in action (installation, deployment, first workflow)
   - Testimonial from own usage: "I use this daily for my own projects, here's what works"
4. Backup plan if recruitment fails:
   - Accept longer validation timeline (4-8 weeks instead of 2-4 weeks)
   - Use own projects as test cases (self-validation)
   - Ship anyway with "experimental" label, iterate based on real usage

**Triggers** (Risk Materializing):
- 2-week recruitment checkpoint: <2 users committed to testing
- 4-week checkpoint: Zero users completed testing
- Feedback delay: Users agree to test but don't follow through (>2 weeks no updates)

**Owner**: Solo Developer (Joseph Magly)

**Residual Risk** (After Mitigation): MEDIUM (mitigation improves recruitment odds, but niche audience remains challenge)

### RISK-008: Iteration Velocity Slows

**Category**: Schedule
**Likelihood**: MEDIUM (40% probability - 1+ commit/day pace unsustainable long-term, competing priorities)
**Impact**: MEDIUM (feature delays, slower feedback loop, reduced competitive advantage)
**Current Status**: Monitoring
**Exposure**: MEDIUM

**Description**:
Ship-now mindset (1+ commit/day) becomes unsustainable as project matures. Testing burden increases, refactoring debt accumulates, support capacity grows. Iteration velocity slows from 35 commits/month to 10-15 commits/month. Feature roadmap delays, feedback loop lengthens, competitive advantage erodes if other frameworks emerge.

**Mitigation Strategy**:
1. Accept velocity reduction as natural:
   - Early phase: 1+ commit/day acceptable (rapid prototyping, feature development)
   - Mature phase: 10-15 commits/month acceptable (stability focus, incremental improvements)
   - Communicate: Update ROADMAP.md with realistic timelines as velocity changes
2. Prioritize ruthlessly:
   - Focus on highest-impact features (user-requested, critical gaps)
   - Defer low-priority work (nice-to-haves, optimizations, refactoring)
   - Use flow-iteration-dual-track to balance feature work vs technical debt
3. Automate to preserve velocity:
   - CI/CD for testing, linting, manifest validation
   - Automated PR acceptance for low-risk changes (docs, linting fixes)
   - Template generation scripts reduce manual work
4. Contributor recruitment offsets velocity reduction:
   - If 2-3 contributors join, aggregate velocity increases even if solo velocity decreases

**Triggers** (Risk Materializing):
- Velocity drops below 10 commits/month for 2+ consecutive months
- Feature roadmap delays accumulate (>1 month behind planned milestones)
- User feedback: "Development seems stalled, is project active?"

**Owner**: Solo Developer (Joseph Magly)

**Residual Risk** (After Mitigation): LOW (velocity reduction expected and acceptable, mitigation strategies preserve critical progress)

---

### RISK-009: Self-Application Maturity Delayed

**Category**: Schedule
**Likelihood**: MEDIUM (40% probability - framework complexity, learning curve, competing work priorities)
**Impact**: MEDIUM (validation delayed, meta-improvements slower, dogfooding benefits unrealized)
**Current Status**: Monitoring
**Exposure**: MEDIUM

**Description**:
Framework self-application (using SDLC tools to manage framework development) takes >9 months to reach maturity. Reasons: Learning curve (agent orchestration, multi-agent workflows), framework complexity (58 agents, 45 commands), competing priorities (feature development vs self-application). Validation loop delayed, meta-improvements slower, practical refinements missed.

**Mitigation Strategy**:
1. Incremental self-application adoption:
   - Phase 1 (Current): Use intake process (this document)
   - Phase 2 (1-2 months): Use flow-iteration-dual-track for development cycles
   - Phase 3 (3-6 months): Add flow-gate-check before major releases
   - Phase 4 (6-9 months): Full SDLC workflows (requirements → architecture → testing → deployment)
2. Track maturity milestones:
   - 3 months: 50% of new features have SDLC artifacts
   - 6 months: 75% of new features have SDLC artifacts
   - 9 months: 100% of new features have SDLC artifacts (full self-application)
3. Document learnings:
   - Iteration retrospectives: What worked, what didn't, what to improve
   - ADRs for process changes (why we adopted X workflow, why we skipped Y)
   - Share findings publicly (blog posts, GitHub Discussions)
4. Accept slower timeline if needed:
   - Self-application is validation loop, not hard deadline
   - Mature framework is priority, forced self-application is counterproductive

**Triggers** (Risk Materializing):
- 9-month checkpoint: <75% of features have SDLC artifacts
- Self-application friction reported: "Framework too complex to use on itself"
- Abandoned workflows: Start self-application, then revert to ad-hoc development

**Owner**: Solo Developer (Joseph Magly)

**Residual Risk** (After Mitigation): LOW (incremental adoption reduces friction, timeline flexibility acceptable)

---

### RISK-010: Performance at Scale Issues

**Category**: Technical
**Likelihood**: LOW (20% probability - documentation project scales well, modular deployment mitigates)
**Impact**: MEDIUM (user frustration, churn, reputation damage, optimization work required)
**Current Status**: Monitoring
**Exposure**: MEDIUM

**Description**:
CLI tools slow (>2 seconds), agent coordination inefficient, documentation overwhelming even at small usage (<100 users). Indicators: User complaints about slow deployment, agent context window saturation, long artifact generation times. Optimization work required, distracting from feature development.

**Mitigation Strategy**:
1. Performance monitoring baseline:
   - Track CLI tool execution times (install, deploy-agents, new-project)
   - Monitor agent context usage (are templates fitting within context windows?)
   - Collect user feedback on performance (surveys, issue reports)
2. Proactive optimizations (low-hanging fruit):
   - Context-optimized documents (already implemented)
   - Modular deployment (users load subsets, not full 58 agents)
   - Caching for repeated operations (manifest generation, linting)
3. Triggered optimizations (only if scale demands):
   - Incremental processing for large codebases (sample-based analysis)
   - Parallel agent processing (multi-agent workflows run concurrently)
   - Repository size limits (warn users if repo >1000 files, suggest exclusions)
4. Accept reasonable limits:
   - Framework targets solo → small teams (not enterprise 1000+ developer orgs)
   - Performance "good enough" for target audience acceptable

**Triggers** (Risk Materializing):
- CLI tools exceed 2 seconds execution time (user-reported frustration)
- 10+ users report performance issues (slow deployment, long artifact generation)
- Agent context window saturation (templates truncated, incomplete analysis)

**Owner**: Solo Developer (Joseph Magly)

**Residual Risk** (After Mitigation): LOW (documentation project scales naturally, modular deployment already mitigates)

---

### RISK-011: Multi-Platform Abstraction Timing Wrong

**Category**: Technical
**Likelihood**: MEDIUM (40% probability - OpenAI/Codex adoption unpredictable, abstraction complexity high)
**Impact**: MEDIUM (wasted effort if premature, missed opportunity if delayed, platform lock-in risk)
**Current Status**: Identified
**Exposure**: MEDIUM

**Description**:
Invest in multi-platform abstraction layer (Claude Code, OpenAI, Codex, Cursor) too early (before demand validated) OR too late (after Claude Code deprecates agents). Premature: Wasted effort on unused features, complexity burden, maintenance overhead. Delayed: Users locked into Claude Code, churn when platform changes, missed adoption from OpenAI/Codex users.

**Mitigation Strategy**:
1. Phased multi-platform support (current approach):
   - Phase 1 (Current): Claude Code primary, OpenAI basic compatibility (agent format conversion)
   - Phase 2 (3-6 months): Measure OpenAI/Codex adoption via surveys ("Which platform do you use?")
   - Phase 3 (6-12 months): Invest in unified abstraction layer IF demand validates (target: 30%+ non-Claude usage)
2. Platform vendor monitoring:
   - Track Claude Code API changes, deprecation announcements
   - Monitor OpenAI agent format evolution
   - Participate in platform communities (detect early signals)
3. Fallback strategies:
   - If Claude Code deprecates agents: Rapid migration to OpenAI/Codex (multi-provider support already present)
   - If OpenAI/Codex adoption stays low (<10%): Accept Claude-only focus, reduce maintenance burden
4. Decision criteria (6-month checkpoint):
   - If OpenAI/Codex usage >30%: Invest in unified abstraction
   - If OpenAI/Codex usage <10%: Maintain basic compatibility, defer abstraction
   - If Claude Code announces deprecation: Accelerate multi-platform work regardless of usage

**Triggers** (Risk Materializing):
- Claude Code deprecates agent support (major API change announced)
- OpenAI/Codex adoption exceeds 40% (significant non-Claude user base)
- User churn due to platform lock-in (requests for Cursor, other platforms)
- Abstraction complexity overwhelms development capacity (maintenance burden unsustainable)

**Owner**: Solo Developer (Joseph Magly)

**Residual Risk** (After Mitigation): LOW (phased approach balances risk, decision criteria clear, fallback strategies defined)

## Risk Monitoring Plan

### Frequency

- **Weekly**: Support capacity tracking (hours spent on issues, PRs, questions)
- **Monthly**: Adoption metrics (GitHub stars, clone analytics, active users), velocity tracking (commits/month)
- **Quarterly**: Value validation (self-assessment, ROI calculation), pivot trigger assessment

### Review Process

1. Update risk status during iteration retrospectives (flow-retrospective-cycle)
2. Add new risks as identified during development
3. Close resolved risks with rationale
4. Escalate show-stopper risks to project status reports (project-status command)

### Escalation Criteria

**YELLOW (Attention Needed)**:
- Any HIGH exposure risk remains "Identified" for >1 month without mitigation progress
- 2+ MEDIUM risks materialize simultaneously
- Support capacity exceeds 10 hours/week for 2+ weeks

**RED (Requires Immediate Action)**:
- SHOW STOPPER risk materializes (burnout indicators present)
- 3+ risks materialize within 1 month (compound risk scenario)
- Support capacity exceeds 15 hours/week for 4+ weeks
- Pivot triggers met (user testing reveals fundamental issues)

## Notes

**Assumptions**:
- User workflows fundamentally sound (validated via early self-application)
- 80-90% intake accuracy achievable (UC-003 success criteria)
- 100 GitHub stars within 6 months achievable (vision document success metric)
- Solo developer capacity sustainable at <10 hours/week with contributor support

**Next Steps**:
1. Archive draft to working directory for review
2. Launch parallel review cycle (Requirements Reviewer, Test Architect, Deployment Manager)
3. Synthesize feedback and baseline risk list
4. Begin weekly risk monitoring (track support capacity, velocity, adoption metrics)
5. Update risk status in first iteration retrospective

**Document Metadata**:
- **Source Analysis**: Vision Document, Solution Profile, UC-001/002/003
- **Risk Categories**: Business (3), Resource (3), Schedule (3), Technical (2)
- **Total Risks**: 11 identified
- **Critical Path Risks**: RISK-001 (adoption), RISK-004 (burnout), RISK-007 (user testing)
