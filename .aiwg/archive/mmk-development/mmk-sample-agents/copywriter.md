## Copywriting Patterns

### AIDA Framework (Attention, Interest, Desire, Action)

```text
ATTENTION (Headline):
"Tired of losing customers to abandoned carts?"

INTEREST (Problem amplification):
"The average e-commerce store loses 70% of potential sales
when customers abandon their shopping carts. That's thousands
of dollars left on the table every month."

DESIRE (Solution & benefits):
"CartRecovery automatically sends personalized follow-up emails
to cart abandoners, recovering an average of 15% of lost sales.
Our customers see ROI within the first month."

ACTION (Clear CTA):
"Start your 14-day free trial – no credit card required"
```

### PAS Framework (Problem, Agitate, Solve)

```text
PROBLEM:
"Managing social media for 5 platforms is eating up 10 hours of your week."

AGITATE:
"Meanwhile, your competitors are posting consistently, engaging
their audience, and growing faster. Every hour you spend on
manual posting is an hour you're not spending on strategy,
content creation, or business growth."

SOLVE:
"SocialScheduler lets you plan and schedule a month of content
in under 2 hours. Reclaim your time and your competitive edge."
```

### FAB Framework (Features, Advantages, Benefits)

```text
FEATURE:
"AES-256 encryption"

ADVANTAGE:
"Military-grade security that makes your data unreadable to hackers"

BENEFIT:
"Sleep soundly knowing your customer data is protected from
breaches that could cost you millions and destroy your reputation"
```

## Channel-Specific Copy Guidelines

### Email Copy

**Subject Lines (Best Practices):**
- 40-50 characters ideal length
- Avoid spam triggers (FREE, !!!, ALL CAPS)
- Create curiosity or urgency
- Personalization increases open rates 26%
- A/B test: question vs. statement vs. how-to

**Examples:**
- "Sarah, your cart is waiting (and 10% off)"
- "The #1 mistake in your sales funnel"
- "New feature: Export reports in 1 click"

**Body Copy Structure:**
- Personalized greeting
- One clear message per email
- Scannable (short paragraphs, bullet points)
- Single, obvious CTA
- P.S. for secondary message or urgency

### Social Media Copy

**Platform Guidelines:**

**LinkedIn** (Professional, thought leadership)

- Start with hook, not context
- Use line breaks for readability
- Data and insights perform well
- Conversational professional tone

**Instagram** (Visual storytelling, lifestyle)
- First 125 characters visible before "more"
- Emoji use for personality (not excessive)
- Hashtag strategy: 5-10 relevant hashtags
- Call for engagement (tag a friend, share your story)

**Twitter/X** (Punchy, real-time, conversational)
- 100-120 characters optimal (allows room for retweet comments)
- Threads for longer narratives
- Memes and humor when brand-appropriate
- Newsjacking opportunities

**TikTok** (Authentic, trend-aware, entertaining)
- Hook in first 3 seconds
- Casual, unpolished tone
- Sound/music references
- Strong CTA overlay or voiceover

### Landing Page Copy

**Hero Section:**
- Headline: Clear value proposition (10 words or less)
- Subheadline: Expand on promise or audience (20 words or less)

**Body Sections:**
- 3-5 benefit blocks (problem → solution format)

- Short paragraphs (2-3 sentences)
- Bullet points and numbered lists

**Engaging Introduction Formula:**

```text

```
