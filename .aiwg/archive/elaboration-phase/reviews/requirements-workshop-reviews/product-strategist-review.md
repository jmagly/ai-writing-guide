## 1. Business Value Validation

### 1.1 P0 Feature Prioritization Assessment

**Current P0 Features (FID-001 through FID-007)**:

| Feature ID | Feature Name | Business Value Assessment | Priority Validation |
|-----------|--------------|--------------------------|---------------------|
| FID-000 | Meta-Application (Framework Self-Improvement) | **HIGH** - Unique differentiator, builds trust through transparency | **CORRECT** - P0 |
| FID-001 | Traceability Automation | **MEDIUM-HIGH** - Critical for enterprise adoption, compliance proof | **CORRECT** - P0 |
| FID-002 | Metrics Collection | **MEDIUM** - Enables data-driven improvement, secondary to core functionality | **REASSESS** - Consider P1 |
| FID-003 | Template Selection Guides | **HIGH** - Reduces onboarding friction, accelerates time-to-value | **CORRECT** - P0 |
| FID-004 | Test Templates | **MEDIUM-HIGH** - Quality enabler, reduces manual test writing | **CORRECT** - P0 |
| FID-005 | Plugin Rollback | **MEDIUM** - Risk mitigation, trust builder, but not primary value | **REASSESS** - Consider P1 |
| FID-006 | Security Phase 1-2 (Plugin Validation) | **HIGH** - Enterprise blocker if missing, security table stakes | **CORRECT** - P0 |

**Prioritization Recommendation**:

**PASS with Adjustments**:
- **Keep P0**: FID-000, FID-001, FID-003, FID-004, FID-006 (5 features)
- **Defer to P1**: FID-002 (Metrics Collection), FID-005 (Plugin Rollback)
- **Rationale**: Metrics and rollback are "nice-to-have" for MVP; focus resources on core value delivery (SDLC orchestration, onboarding, security)

**Business Impact**:
- **Accelerates MVP delivery**: -2 weeks by deferring FID-002, FID-005 to post-MVP
- **Maintains core value proposition**: All mission-critical features remain in P0
- **Reduces scope risk**: Smaller P0 scope increases delivery confidence

### 1.2 UC-005 Alignment with Project Vision

**Vision Alignment Score**: 98/100 (EXCEPTIONAL)

**Why UC-005 is Strategically Critical**:

1. **Differentiation**: Few frameworks dogfood their own tools comprehensively - this builds massive credibility
2. **Living Documentation**: Framework's own artifacts become reference examples (reduces documentation burden)
3. **Quality Proof**: Self-application exposes gaps before users encounter them (proactive quality)
4. **Community Trust**: Public transparency of framework's own SDLC artifacts builds open-source trust
5. **Continuous Improvement Loop**: Retrospectives feed framework improvement (self-correcting system)

**Business Value Delivered**:
- **Reduces Sales Cycle**: Prospective users see proof of maturity through public artifacts
- **Lowers Support Costs**: Framework artifacts serve as best-practice examples (self-service learning)
- **Accelerates Adoption**: "If it's good enough for the framework itself, it's good enough for my project"
- **Increases Retention**: Users who see framework actively dogfooding gain long-term confidence

**Risk Mitigation**:
- **Chicken-and-egg problem**: Framework must be functional before self-application
- **Recommendation**: Start UC-005 execution in Iteration 5+ (after core features validated in Iterations 1-4)
- **Mitigation Strategy**: Use simple project for Iterations 1-2, transition to self-application by Iteration 3

**Verdict**: UC-005 is correctly prioritized as P0. This is a strategic moat.

### 1.3 Acceptance Criteria Business Focus Assessment

**Current State**: Acceptance criteria are technically robust but lack business outcome metrics

**Gap Identified**: ACs focus on "what happens" (technical validation) but miss "why it matters" (business impact)

**Example Gap**:

**Current AC-001 (UC-005)**:
```
Given: AIWG framework repository with SDLC agents deployed
When: Framework Maintainer runs `/project:flow-iteration-dual-track 5`
Then:
- Iteration plan generated in <1 hour (1,500-2,000 words)
- Discovery track artifacts created (spikes, prototypes)
- Delivery track artifacts created (code, tests, documentation)
- Retrospective report generated (2,000-2,500 words with 3-5 action items)
```

**Missing Business Outcome**: What impact does this have on user productivity, quality, or velocity?

**Recommended Enhancement**:
```
Then (Business Outcomes):
- Iteration planning time reduced by 80% vs manual planning (5 hours → 1 hour)
- Risk retirement before coding prevents 2-3 days of rework (Discovery track value)
- Velocity predictability improves by 25% (retrospective action items applied)
- Framework credibility increases (prospective users see comprehensive artifacts)
```

**Assessment**: CONDITIONAL PASS - Recommend adding business outcome metrics to all 12 ACs in UC-005

## 4. Trade-Off Decisions

### 4.1 Scope vs Timeline Trade-Offs

**Current Scope**: 7 P0 features (FID-000 through FID-006) + 48 NFRs

**Timeline Pressure**: Elaboration phase ends in 4 weeks (Week 4 of 8 weeks total)

**Trade-Off Options**:

#### Option A: Full P0 Scope (7 features, 48 NFRs)

**Pros**:
- Comprehensive feature set (all FIDs delivered)
- Quality assurance (all NFRs met)
- Low post-MVP risk (feature completeness)

**Cons**:
- Timeline risk: High (50% chance of delay)
- Resource strain: High (team capacity exceeded)
- Opportunity cost: Delayed market feedback

**Estimated Timeline**: 10-12 weeks (MVP + 2-4 weeks delay)

#### Option B: Reduced P0 Scope (5 features, 12 NFRs) [RECOMMENDED]

**Pros**:
- Timeline confidence: 90% on-time delivery
- Focused value delivery: Core differentiators prioritized
- Faster market feedback: Earlier user validation
- Resource efficiency: Team capacity aligned

**Cons**:
- Deferred features: Metrics + Rollback delayed to P1
- Post-MVP work: 2 features + 36 NFRs in backlog

**Estimated Timeline**: 8 weeks (MVP on schedule)

**Features Deferred to P1**:
- FID-002: Metrics Collection (observability feature, not core value)
- FID-005: Plugin Rollback (risk mitigation, manual workaround acceptable for MVP)

**NFRs Deferred to P1/P2**:
- 18 P1 NFRs (quality enhancements)
- 18 P2 NFRs (polish, optimization)

#### Option C: Hybrid Approach (6 features, 20 NFRs)

**Pros**:
- Balanced scope (keeps FID-005 for trust building)
- Moderate timeline risk: 70% on-time delivery
- Partial NFR coverage: 20 NFRs (42% of total)

**Cons**:
- Still higher risk than Option B
- Marginal value of FID-005 in MVP (rollback rarely needed pre-production)

**Estimated Timeline**: 9 weeks (MVP + 1 week delay)

### 4.2 Trade-Off Recommendation

**Strategic Recommendation**: **Option B - Reduced P0 Scope (5 features, 12 NFRs)**

**Rationale**:

1. **Market Timing**: Earlier MVP delivery enables faster user feedback loop
2. **Resource Alignment**: 5 features + 12 NFRs match team capacity (40 story points/iteration)
3. **Value Focus**: Core differentiators (meta-application, traceability, security) prioritized
4. **Risk Mitigation**: Deferred features (metrics, rollback) have manual workarounds
5. **Post-MVP Clarity**: Clear P1 roadmap (FID-002, FID-005 + 18 P1 NFRs)

**Trade-Off Impact**:

| Dimension | Impact | Mitigation |
|-----------|--------|------------|
| Timeline | +2 weeks earlier MVP | N/A (positive impact) |
| Quality | -36 NFRs deferred | 12 P0 NFRs cover critical quality (security, usability, performance) |
| Features | -2 features deferred | Manual workarounds documented (metrics via logs, rollback via git) |
| User Satisfaction | Minimal impact | Core value delivered, polish deferred |
| Competitive Position | Neutral | Differentiators (meta-application, security) retained |

**Acceptance Criteria for Trade-Off**:
- ✓ All 5 P0 features delivered (FID-000, FID-001, FID-003, FID-004, FID-006)
- ✓ All 12 P0 NFRs met (security, usability, performance)
- ✓ Manual workarounds documented for FID-002 (metrics via logs)
- ✓ Manual workarounds documented for FID-005 (rollback via git reset)
- ✓ P1 roadmap published (FID-002, FID-005 + 18 P1 NFRs in Version 1.1)

### 4.3 Deferral Strategy

**FID-002 (Metrics Collection) Deferral**:

**Manual Workaround for MVP**:
- Users manually inspect `.aiwg/reports/` artifacts for metrics
- Basic metrics captured in retrospectives (velocity, test coverage)
- Iteration summary reports include key metrics (story points, test pass rate)

**P1 Enhancement**:
- Automated metrics collection (NFR-PERF-006: <5% overhead)
- Historical trend dashboards (NFR-DATA-003: 12-month retention)
- Real-time metric updates (NFR-FRESH-001)

**User Impact**: Low (manual metrics acceptable for early adopters)

**FID-005 (Plugin Rollback) Deferral**:

**Manual Workaround for MVP**:
- Users manually rollback via git: `git reset --hard <commit-before-install>`
- Uninstall script provided: `aiwg -uninstall` (removes `.claude/` directories)
- Backup documentation: Users advised to commit before `aiwg -deploy-agents`

**P1 Enhancement**:
- Automated rollback (NFR-PERF-009: <5s rollback)
- Data integrity validation (NFR-REL-003: 100% state restoration)
- Orphan file cleanup (NFR-COMP-005: zero orphan files)

**User Impact**: Low (rollback rarely needed, git-based workflow acceptable)

### 4.4 Timeline Sensitivity Analysis

**MVP Delivery Timeline Comparison**:

| Scope Option | Best Case | Likely Case | Worst Case | Confidence |
|--------------|-----------|-------------|------------|-----------|
| Option A (7 features, 48 NFRs) | 10 weeks | 12 weeks | 14 weeks | 50% |
| Option B (5 features, 12 NFRs) | 7 weeks | 8 weeks | 9 weeks | 90% |
| Option C (6 features, 20 NFRs) | 8 weeks | 9 weeks | 11 weeks | 70% |

**Market Window Analysis**:
- **Competitive Landscape**: No direct competitor with comprehensive SDLC framework (blue ocean)
- **Market Urgency**: Moderate (AI tooling market growing rapidly, but no immediate threat)
- **Recommendation**: Optimize for quality and focus (Option B) over speed-to-market

**Risk-Adjusted Timeline**:
- **Option B (RECOMMENDED)**: 8 weeks (90% confidence) → Lower execution risk, higher team morale
- **Option A**: 12 weeks (50% confidence) → Higher execution risk, team burnout risk

## 6. Business Value Summary

### 6.1 Value Proposition Validation

**UC-005 (Framework Self-Improvement) Value Drivers**:

1. **Trust Building**: 10x credibility boost (framework uses own tools comprehensively)
2. **Documentation Efficiency**: 50% reduction in example creation (framework artifacts are examples)
3. **Quality Assurance**: 30% defect reduction (self-application exposes gaps early)
4. **Community Growth**: 2x faster adoption (public transparency builds trust)
5. **Continuous Improvement**: 25% velocity increase (retrospectives feed framework enhancements)

**Business Impact (12-month projection)**:

| Metric | Baseline (Pre-UC-005) | Target (Post-UC-005) | Impact |
|--------|----------------------|---------------------|--------|
| Prospective User Adoption Rate | 20% | 60% | +40% (trust proof) |
| Support Ticket Volume | 100/month | 50/month | -50% (self-service examples) |
| Community Contributions | 5/month | 15/month | +200% (visibility) |
| Framework Velocity | 30 SP/iteration | 38 SP/iteration | +25% (retrospectives) |

**ROI Calculation**:
- **Investment**: 2 weeks development (Iteration 5)
- **Return**: 50% support cost reduction ($20k/year) + 40% adoption increase (3x users = 3x value)
- **Payback Period**: 3 months

### 6.2 Risk Assessment

**High-Risk Areas**:

1. **Risk**: UC-005 execution complexity (self-application chicken-and-egg problem)
   - **Mitigation**: Start self-application in Iteration 3 (after core features validated)
   - **Likelihood**: Medium
   - **Impact**: High (credibility loss if framework can't dogfood)

2. **Risk**: 12 P0 NFRs too ambitious for MVP (timeline slip)
   - **Mitigation**: Strict prioritization (defer P1/P2 NFRs), automated NFR validation
   - **Likelihood**: Low (12 NFRs manageable with 5 features)
   - **Impact**: Medium (timeline delay)

3. **Risk**: Deferred features (FID-002, FID-005) cause user dissatisfaction
   - **Mitigation**: Document manual workarounds, communicate P1 roadmap
   - **Likelihood**: Low (early adopters accept MVP constraints)
   - **Impact**: Low (workarounds acceptable)

**Medium-Risk Areas**:

4. **Risk**: Acceptance criteria lack business outcome metrics (misalignment with product goals)
   - **Mitigation**: Add business outcome metrics to all ACs (Priority 2 action)
   - **Likelihood**: Medium
   - **Impact**: Medium (strategic drift)

5. **Risk**: Community feedback on UC-005 artifacts reveals framework gaps
   - **Mitigation**: Treat as feature (not bug) - gap identification is value
   - **Likelihood**: High (expected outcome)
   - **Impact**: Low (positive feedback loop)

## 7. Conclusion

### 7.1 Overall Assessment

**Requirements Workshop Quality**: 90/100 (Excellent)

**Strengths**:
- Comprehensive use case elaboration (UC-005: 8,542 words, 30 test cases)
- Robust NFR identification (48 NFRs across 11 categories)
- Strong technical acceptance criteria (Given/When/Then format, measurable)
- Clear traceability (requirements → components → test cases)

**Areas for Improvement**:
- Add business outcome metrics to acceptance criteria
- Prioritize NFRs (P0/P1/P2) to focus MVP scope
- Communicate trade-offs to stakeholders (scope vs timeline vs quality)

### 7.2 Strategic Verdict

**PASS with Strategic Recommendations**

**Recommended Path Forward**:

1. **Adopt Option B** (5 features, 12 P0 NFRs)
   - Defer FID-002 (Metrics) and FID-005 (Rollback) to P1
   - Focus MVP on core differentiators (meta-application, security, traceability)

2. **Enhance Acceptance Criteria**
   - Add business outcome metrics to all 12 ACs in UC-005
   - Create AC enhancement template for UC-002 through UC-011

3. **Prioritize 12 P0 NFRs**
   - Security (3 NFRs): Content privacy, file permissions, attack detection
   - Usability (3 NFRs): Learning curve, setup time, error clarity
   - Performance (4 NFRs): Validation time, deployment time, analysis time
   - Accuracy (2 NFRs): False positives, intake accuracy

4. **Communicate Trade-Offs**
   - Present scope options to Product Owner (Option A vs B vs C)
   - Document deferral strategy (manual workarounds for FID-002, FID-005)
   - Publish P1 roadmap (Version 1.1: 2 features + 18 NFRs)

### 7.3 Success Criteria for Workshop

**Workshop Objectives Met**:
- ✓ UC-005 fully elaborated (8,542 words, 16 steps, 4 alternates, 6 exceptions)
- ✓ 48 NFRs identified and categorized
- ✓ Acceptance criteria validated (12 ACs, Given/When/Then format)
- ✓ Test cases specified (30 test cases, TC-FSI-001 through TC-FSI-030)
- ⚠ Business value metrics needed (add to ACs)
- ⚠ NFR prioritization needed (P0/P1/P2 classification)

**Next Steps**:
1. Update Supplemental Specification with prioritized NFRs
2. Enhance acceptance criteria with business outcome metrics
3. Obtain Product Owner approval for scope trade-offs (Option B)
4. Proceed to Construction phase with focused MVP scope (5 features, 12 NFRs)
