## Go/No-Go Decision

### Decision: **GO TO ELABORATION**

### Rationale

**Why GO**:
1. **Vision Clarity**: Problem, personas, and success metrics clearly articulated
2. **Risk Management**: All critical risks have mitigation plans (Option B implementation)
3. **Architecture Foundation**: Component boundaries, integration points, and technology stack documented
4. **Funding Secured**: Solo developer time committed (open source model)
5. **No Show Stoppers**: All blocking risks have documented mitigations or acceptance rationales
6. **Executable Baseline**: Current codebase is already functional (framework works, needs formalization)

**Why CONDITIONAL** (per LOM validation report):
- Inception artifacts were implicit (vision across documents, risks in analysis report)
- This flow execution formalized artifacts into standard SDLC templates
- Condition MET: Formal artifacts now created, ready for Elaboration phase

**Confidence Level**: **HIGH**
- Solo developer has complete decision authority (no external approvals required)
- Path to v1.0 is clear (Option B 4-week implementation)
- Risks are well-understood and manageable
- Architecture is proven (framework already operational)

### Gaps to Address in Elaboration

**Week 1-2** (Architecture Documentation):
1. Create full Software Architecture Document (SAD) - expand architecture-sketch.md
2. Add more ADRs as needed (Node.js runtime choice, npm-free distribution, etc.)
3. Document component interfaces and contracts

**Week 3-4** (Executable Baseline Validation):
4. Add smoke tests for deploy-agents.mjs, new-project.mjs, install.sh
5. Cross-platform testing (Ubuntu 20.04, 22.04, macOS, WSL)
6. CI/CD test workflow (GitHub Actions)

**Week 5-6** (Risk Retirement):
7. Implement semantic versioning (v1.0.0-rc.1)
8. Create CHANGELOG.md
9. Document upgrade procedure

**Week 7-8** (Requirements Baseline + ABM):
10. Document features as use cases (10+ use cases)
11. Create supplemental specification (NFRs)
12. Create Master Test Plan
13. Conduct ABM review for v1.0.0 release
