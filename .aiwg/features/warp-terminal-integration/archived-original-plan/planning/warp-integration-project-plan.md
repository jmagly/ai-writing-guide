- Primary Contributors: Technical Researcher, Requirements Analyst, Architecture Designer, Software Implementer, Test Engineer, Technical Writer, DevOps Engineer
- Stakeholders: Development team, end users, AIWG community
- Review Cycle: Weekly progress check, milestone gate reviews

## Project Overview

### Project ID
WARP-INT-001

### Timeline
- Start Date: 2025-10-17
- Target Completion: 2025-11-15 (30 calendar days)
- Total Effort: 120-160 hours

### Phase
Elaboration â†’ Construction

### Summary Objectives
Integrate Warp AI platform as a third provider option for AIWG framework, enabling users to deploy agents and commands targeting Warp's API and capabilities while maintaining backward compatibility with existing Claude and OpenAI implementations.

## Goals and Evaluation Criteria

### Business Goals
1. **Market Expansion**: Support users who prefer or require Warp AI platform
2. **Competitive Positioning**: Maintain AIWG as platform-agnostic, multi-provider framework
3. **User Choice**: Enable users to select optimal provider based on cost, performance, or compliance needs
4. **Future Extensibility**: Establish pattern for adding additional providers (Anthropic, Cohere, etc.)

### Technical Goals
1. **Platform Parity**: Warp deployment achieves feature parity with Claude/OpenAI deployments
2. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing Claude and OpenAI deployments continue functioning without modification
3. **Code Quality**: New code maintains or exceeds existing test coverage (>80%)
4. **Documentation Quality**: Users can successfully deploy Warp agents without support requests
5. **Performance**: Deployment script execution time remains under 30 seconds for all providers

### Acceptance Criteria
1. `aiwg -deploy-agents --provider warp` successfully deploys all 58 SDLC agents to `.warp/agents/`
2. `aiwg -deploy-commands --provider warp` successfully deploys all 42+ commands to `.warp/commands/`
3. Warp-deployed agents reference correct model names (warp-reasoning, warp-coding, warp-efficiency or custom)
4. All existing tests pass (no regressions)
5. New tests cover Warp provider code paths (>80% coverage)
6. Documentation includes Warp examples and troubleshooting
7. CLI help text includes Warp provider option
8. Warp provider officially listed in README, CLAUDE.md, and multi-provider documentation

## Critical Path

The critical path for this project is:

**WBS-1.1 â†’ WBS-1.3 â†’ WBS-2.1 â†’ WBS-3.1 â†’ WBS-4.1 â†’ WBS-4.3 â†’ WBS-5.1 â†’ WBS-5.2 â†’ WBS-5.3 â†’ WBS-7.1 â†’ WBS-7.2 â†’ WBS-7.3**

**Total Critical Path Duration**: ~85-110 hours

**Key Critical Path Items**:
1. **Warp Platform Research (WBS-1.1)**: Must understand Warp capabilities before design
2. **Provider Abstraction Design (WBS-3.1)**: Architecture foundation for implementation
3. **Core Provider Support (WBS-4.1)**: Foundation for all deployment logic
4. **Agent Deployment Logic (WBS-4.3)**: Core functionality for agent deployment
5. **Testing (WBS-5.1-5.3)**: Quality gate before release
6. **Deployment (WBS-7.1-7.3)**: Final release activities

**Optimization Opportunities**:
- **Parallelize Research and Requirements**: WBS-2.1 can start once WBS-1.1 completes (don't wait for WBS-1.2)
- **Parallelize Implementation**: WBS-4.2 (CLI) and WBS-4.4 (Commands) can run in parallel with WBS-4.3 (Agents)
- **Parallelize Documentation**: WBS-6.1-6.3 can start once WBS-4.6 completes (don't wait for all testing)

## Risks and Mitigation Strategies

### Risk Register

| Risk ID | Risk Description | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy | Contingency Plan |
|---------|-----------------|------------|--------|-------------------|-----------------|
| R-1 | Warp API documentation incomplete or unclear | Medium | High | Start research early; engage Warp support if needed | Use OpenAI implementation as reference; make assumptions and document them |
| R-2 | Warp model naming conventions don't fit reasoning/coding/efficiency paradigm | Medium | Medium | Research Warp model tiers early; design flexible mapping | Allow fully custom model names via CLI overrides; document mapping strategy |
| R-3 | Breaking changes to existing Claude/OpenAI deployments | Low | Critical | Comprehensive regression testing; code review | Rollback release; issue hotfix; communicate with users |
| R-4 | Insufficient test coverage for Warp code paths | Medium | High | Prioritize test development; enforce >80% coverage gate | Extend testing phase; defer release if needed |
| R-5 | Performance degradation in deployment script | Low | Medium | Benchmark before/after; optimize critical paths | Refactor inefficient code; cache computed values |
| R-6 | Documentation clarity issues lead to support burden | Medium | Medium | User testing of documentation; peer review | Iterate on documentation post-release; create video tutorials |
| R-7 | Warp API access unavailable for testing | Medium | High | Mock Warp API for unit/integration tests | Test with Claude/OpenAI as proxies; community beta testing |
| R-8 | Scope creep (requests for Warp-specific features) | High | Medium | Enforce scope boundaries; defer to future iterations | Document feature requests; prioritize for next iteration |
| R-9 | Resource availability (key team members unavailable) | Low | High | Cross-train team members; document knowledge | Adjust timeline; redistribute tasks |
| R-10 | Third-party dependency issues (Node.js, filesystem APIs) | Low | Medium | Use stable, well-tested libraries; avoid bleeding-edge features | Test across environments; provide workarounds |
