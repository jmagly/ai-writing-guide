**Document Owner**: Project Manager
**Contributors**: Product Strategist, System Analyst, Requirements Analyst
**Version**: v1.0
**Date**: 2025-10-17
**Status**: DRAFT

## Executive Summary

**Context**: AI Writing Guide has reached pre-launch readiness (485 files, 105 commits, 3 months development). Strategic decision required: Continue custom framework development, adopt existing tools, maintain chat-only approach, or pursue hybrid strategy.

**Recommendation**: **Option 1 - Continue Development** (weighted score: 4.15/5.0)

**Key Trade-offs**:
- Higher development investment (6-12 months to maturity) vs proven tooling (immediate)
- Differentiated positioning (only LLM-first SDLC+writing framework) vs commodity
- Zero budget constraint limits scale, but modular design mitigates risk

**Fallback Strategy**: If <5 GitHub stars after 3 months OR support >20 hours/week, pivot to Option 4 (Hybrid: Generic SDLC + custom writing tools only)

- **Strategic Benefits (0.15)**: Long-term positioning, differentiation, community potential

---

## Option 1: Continue Development (Build Custom Framework)

### Description

Continue evolving AI Writing Guide as comprehensive dual-purpose framework:
- **Writing Quality**: 3 specialized agents, validation rules, banned patterns, examples
- **SDLC Complete**: 58 agents, 45 commands, 156 templates covering Inception → Production
- **Tooling**: CLI (`aiwg`), deployment automation, manifest management, linting
- **Distribution**: GitHub repository, one-line bash installer, MIT license

**Current State**: 485 files, 105 commits (3 months), pre-launch readiness, 0 active users

### Scoring Analysis

| Criterion | Score | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| **Cost** | 3.0 | **Moderate-High Development Cost**: 6-12 months to maturity (v1.0), ongoing maintenance 5-10 hours/week. Zero budget sustainable for solo developer, but limits scale. **Trade-off**: Volunteer time investment vs potential long-term impact. |
| **Time to Value** | 3.5 | **Moderate Time**: Pre-launch ready (can ship now), but 3-6 months validation needed (5-10 early adopters). Value emerges gradually as community grows. **Mitigation**: Ship-now mindset allows rapid iteration based on feedback. |
| **Risk** | 3.0 | **Moderate Risk**: Untested market (zero adoption proof), solo developer capacity constraints, wrong workflows possible (user validation needed). **Mitigation**: Modular deployment (users choose subsets), self-application dogfooding, rapid pivot capability. **Key Risk**: Zero adoption → accept personal tool path. |
| **Fit with Priorities** | 5.0 | **Excellent Fit**: Directly addresses core mission (AI authenticity + SDLC structure), targets underserved niche (AI-assisted workers needing structure without enterprise overhead), LLM-first design optimized for agent consumption. **Unique Positioning**: Only framework combining writing quality + comprehensive SDLC. |
| **Strategic Benefits** | 5.0 | **Excellent Strategic Position**: Differentiated (no direct competition), extensible (community can contribute), multi-platform (Claude + OpenAI), self-improving (framework maintains itself). **Upside**: If adoption succeeds (100+ users), community-driven sustainability. **Optionality**: Can pivot to hybrid (drop SDLC, keep writing tools) or commercial (paid support) based on traction. |

### Benefits

**Primary**:
1. **Differentiated Positioning**: Only solution combining AI detection avoidance + comprehensive SDLC toolkit
2. **LLM-First Design**: Optimized for agent consumption (context-optimized docs, natural language orchestration)
3. **Multi-Agent Orchestration**: Built-in patterns for collaborative artifact generation (primary author → reviewers → synthesizer)
4. **Zero Budget Sustainability**: Free hosting (GitHub), no paid dependencies, community-driven

**Secondary**:
5. **Self-Application Validation**: Framework maintains itself using own tools (validates practicality, surfaces friction)
6. **Modular Deployment**: Users choose general/SDLC/both (avoids overwhelming context)
7. **Rapid Iteration**: Ship-now mindset allows pivoting based on feedback (not locked into waterfall plan)
8. **Community Extensibility**: Open source (MIT) enables forks, contributions, adaptations

### Costs & Investment

**Development Time** (cumulative):
- **Pre-launch (complete)**: 3 months, ~105 commits, 485 files
- **Phase 1 - Validation (0-3 months)**: 40-60 hours (user support, bug fixes, iteration based on feedback)
- **Phase 2 - Growth (3-6 months)**: 80-120 hours (community infrastructure, contributor onboarding, feature expansion)
- **Phase 3 - Scale (6-12 months)**: 120-180 hours (performance optimization, advanced features, platform integrations)
- **Ongoing Maintenance**: 5-10 hours/week (issue triage, PR review, documentation updates)

**Budget**:
- **Infrastructure**: $0 (GitHub free tier, no paid services)
- **Domains/Marketing**: $0 (GitHub-only distribution)
- **Total Cash Outlay**: $0 (volunteer time only)

**Opportunity Cost**:
- Time not spent on other projects (quantified: ~300-400 hours over 12 months)
- Alternative: consulting/freelance work (~$15k-$40k at $50-$100/hr rates)

### Risks & Mitigation

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|------------|
| **Zero Adoption** (no users post-launch) | Medium | Medium | **Accept personal-tool path**: Continue using for own projects, no community support burden. **Trigger**: <5 stars after 3 months → Reduce maintenance to <5 hours/week. |
| **Wrong Workflows** (user testing reveals fundamental issues) | Low | High | **Rapid Pivot**: Ship-now mindset allows iteration. **Trigger**: 3/5 early adopters report "confusing" → Conduct interviews, prototype alternatives. |
| **Support Capacity Overwhelmed** | Medium | High | **Self-Service Infrastructure**: FAQs, discussions, PR patterns. **Trigger**: >15 hours/week support for 4+ weeks → Implement self-service OR reduce scope OR commercial transition. |
| **Performance Issues at Scale** | Low | Medium | **Optimization Backlog**: Triggered by reports. **Mitigation**: Modular deployment (users load subsets), context-optimized docs. **Trigger**: 10+ users report performance degradation. |
| **Platform Vendor Changes** (Claude/OpenAI API changes) | Low | High | **Multi-Platform Support**: Already supports Claude + OpenAI. **Mitigation**: Monitor changelogs, abstract platform dependencies. **Trigger**: API deprecation notices. |
| **Contributor Attrition** (no community growth) | Medium | Medium | **Solo Developer Sustainable**: Framework designed for <10 hours/week maintenance. **Trigger**: Zero contributors after 6 months → Accept solo-maintained status. |

### Success Criteria

**Phase 1 - Validation (0-3 months)**:
- 10+ successful installations
- 5-10 GitHub stars
- 2-5 users complete Inception → Elaboration cycle
- Baseline AI detection pass rate established (2-3 on 5-point scale)

**Phase 2 - Growth (3-6 months)**:
- 25-50 GitHub stars
- 1-2 regular contributors (3+ PRs in 90 days)
- 10-20 projects with `.aiwg/` artifacts
- 30-40% users report "Often/Always" pass AI detection (4-5 on scale)

**Phase 3 - Scale (6-12 months)**:
- 100+ GitHub stars
- 2-3 regular contributors
- 50+ active users (30-day activity)
- 50%+ users report "Often/Always" pass AI detection
- 100% framework features have own SDLC artifacts (full self-application)

---

## Option 2: Adopt Existing Tools (Jira/Confluence/Generic SDLC)

### Description

Abandon custom framework development. Use existing SDLC tools:
- **Requirements**: Jira (user stories, epics, sprints)
- **Documentation**: Confluence (architecture, runbooks, policies)
- **Writing Quality**: Generic writing guides (Strunk & White, technical writing handbooks)
- **Validation**: AI detection tools (GPTZero, Originality.ai) for reactive checking

**Integration**: Adapt existing templates from Atlassian, GitHub template repos, generic SDLC resources.

### Scoring Analysis

| Criterion | Score | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| **Cost** | 4.5 | **Low Development Cost**: Zero custom development (use existing tools). **Budget**: Jira free tier (10 users), Confluence free tier (10 users), or GitHub Projects (free). **Time**: <10 hours setup. **Trade-off**: Licensing costs if scale (Jira Standard $7.75/user/month, Confluence $6.05/user/month for 11+ users). |
| **Time to Value** | 5.0 | **Immediate**: Jira/Confluence available today, templates exist, no development required. **Validation**: Proven tools, millions of users, established best practices. **Speed**: 1-2 weeks to adapt templates, train team, operational immediately. |
| **Risk** | 4.0 | **Low Technical Risk**: Mature tools, battle-tested, extensive support/docs. **Market Risk**: Zero adoption risk (proven demand). **Vendor Risk**: Platform lock-in (Atlassian, GitHub), pricing changes, feature deprecation. **Process Risk**: Generic templates may not fit agentic/AI-assisted workflows. |
| **Fit with Priorities** | 2.0 | **Poor Fit**: Does NOT address core mission (AI detection patterns ignored, no writing quality validation, not LLM-first design). **Solves**: SDLC structure only (not dual-purpose framework). **Gap**: No specialized agents, no natural language orchestration, no multi-agent patterns. |
| **Strategic Benefits** | 2.0 | **Weak Strategic Position**: Commodity solution (no differentiation), no community ownership (vendor-controlled), not extensible (closed ecosystems). **Upside**: Proven reliability, established ecosystems, integrations available. **Downside**: No unique value, cannot contribute improvements, vendor dependency. |

### Benefits

1. **Immediate Availability**: Jira/Confluence operational in days (not months)
2. **Proven Reliability**: Mature tools, battle-tested at scale
3. **Extensive Integrations**: GitHub, Slack, CI/CD tools, etc.
4. **Established Best Practices**: Templates, training, support readily available
5. **Team Collaboration**: Multi-user, permissions, workflows, notifications

### Costs & Investment

**Time**:
- Setup: 10-20 hours (configure Jira, adapt templates, train team)
- Ongoing: 2-5 hours/week (triage, updates, maintenance)

**Budget**:
- Free tier: $0 (up to 10 users)
- Paid tier: ~$14-$20/user/month (Jira + Confluence Standard for 1-10 users)
- AI detection tools: $20-$50/month (GPTZero, Originality.ai subscriptions)

### Risks & Mitigation

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|------------|
| **Vendor Lock-In** | High | Medium | **Data Export**: Regular backups, migrate to alternatives if pricing/features change. |
| **Not LLM-Optimized** | High | High | **Gap**: Jira/Confluence NOT designed for agent consumption (UI-first, not context-optimized). **Impact**: Framework's core value (LLM-first design) lost. |
| **No Writing Quality Validation** | High | High | **Gap**: Generic guides don't address AI detection patterns. **Workaround**: Use reactive detection tools (GPTZero), but preventive guidance missing. |
| **Licensing Costs at Scale** | Medium | Medium | **Free tier limits**: 10 users max. **Cost**: $140-$200/month for 10-user team (Jira + Confluence). |
| **Generic Templates Don't Fit** | High | Medium | **Gap**: Atlassian templates not optimized for agentic workflows (multi-agent orchestration, natural language triggers). **Workaround**: Heavy customization required (negates "immediate value" benefit). |

### Why This Doesn't Fit

**Core Mission Mismatch**:
1. **Writing Quality**: Generic guides (Strunk & White) don't address AI detection patterns, no specialized writing agents, no banned phrase validation
2. **LLM-First Design**: Jira/Confluence UI-first (not optimized for agent consumption), no natural language orchestration, no context-optimized docs
3. **Multi-Agent Orchestration**: No built-in patterns for collaborative artifact generation (primary author → reviewers → synthesizer)
4. **Zero Budget**: Free tier limited (10 users), paid tiers add costs ($140+/month for small team)
5. **Strategic Positioning**: Commodity solution (no differentiation), cannot contribute improvements (vendor-controlled)

**When This Makes Sense**:
- **Not** for AI Writing Guide (mission mismatch)
- **Yes** for established teams needing proven collaboration tools (not solo developer, not LLM-first)
- **Yes** for enterprises with budget and integration requirements (not zero-cost constraint)

---

## Option 3: Manual Process Only (Do Nothing, Continue Chat-Only)

### Description

Abandon structured framework entirely. Continue agentic coding via unstructured chat:
- **Requirements**: Discussed in chat, no formal artifacts
- **Architecture**: Code as documentation, README for overview
- **Testing**: Manual testing, ad-hoc validation
- **Deployment**: Manual scripts, no runbooks
- **Writing Quality**: Ad-hoc prompting, no systematic validation

**Philosophy**: "Just build it" - code first, document later (if at all), rely on LLM memory within chat sessions.

### Scoring Analysis

| Criterion | Score | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| **Cost** | 5.0 | **Zero Cost**: No development, no tooling, no setup. **Time**: 0 hours. **Budget**: $0. **Trade-off**: Zero upfront investment, but high long-term cost (lack of traceability, knowledge loss, rework). |
| **Time to Value** | 2.0 | **Instant (but low value)**: Operational immediately (already doing this), but provides NO structure, NO traceability, NO artifact reuse. **Gap**: Does not address core problem (unstructured chat logs). |
| **Risk** | 2.0 | **High Risk**: No traceability (compliance impossible), knowledge loss (context resets between sessions), no artifact reuse (rework common), scaling impossible (cannot onboard contributors). **Critical Gap**: Fails core mission (provide structure for agentic workflows). |
| **Fit with Priorities** | 1.0 | **Very Poor Fit**: Directly OPPOSES core mission (structured SDLC artifacts, traceability, writing validation). **Gap**: No writing quality validation, no SDLC structure, no multi-agent orchestration. **Status Quo**: This is the problem AIWG aims to solve. |
| **Strategic Benefits** | 1.0 | **No Strategic Value**: Commodity approach (everyone defaults to this), no differentiation, no community, no extensibility. **Zero Upside**: Cannot build on prior work, cannot share knowledge, cannot contribute to ecosystem. |

### Benefits

1. **Zero Setup**: Operational immediately (already doing this)
2. **Maximum Flexibility**: No constraints, iterate freely
3. **Low Cognitive Overhead**: No templates, no process, just chat

### Costs & Investment

**Time**: 0 hours (no setup)
**Budget**: $0

**Hidden Costs**:
- **Rework**: Context resets → repeat questions, regenerate artifacts
- **Knowledge Loss**: No persistent artifacts → contributor onboarding impossible
- **Compliance Gap**: No traceability → regulated industries cannot use approach
- **Scaling Limits**: Cannot grow beyond solo developer (no shared artifacts)

### Risks & Mitigation

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|------------|
| **Zero Traceability** | Certain | High | **Impact**: Compliance impossible (HIPAA, SOC2, PCI-DSS). **Gap**: Cannot demonstrate controls for auditors. **No mitigation**: Manual process fundamentally lacks traceability. |
| **Knowledge Loss** | Certain | High | **Impact**: Context resets between sessions → repeat work. **No mitigation**: Chat logs are linear, not structured artifacts. |
| **Scaling Impossible** | Certain | High | **Impact**: Cannot onboard contributors (no shared understanding), cannot reuse artifacts (everything ephemeral). **No mitigation**: Manual chat does not create persistent shared context. |
| **No Writing Validation** | Certain | High | **Impact**: AI detection patterns persist (no systematic validation). **No mitigation**: Ad-hoc prompting lacks consistency. |

### Why This Doesn't Fit

**Core Mission Rejection**:
- This is **the problem AIWG aims to solve** (unstructured chat → structured artifacts)
- Choosing this option means abandoning framework entirely
- Zero strategic value (status quo for everyone, no differentiation)

**When This Makes Sense**:
- **Not** for AI Writing Guide (directly opposes mission)
- **Yes** for throwaway prototypes (experiments, spikes, learning exercises)
- **Yes** for solo developers with perfect memory and zero compliance needs (rare)

**Verdict**: This is the "do nothing" baseline. Not a viable strategic option for AIWG.

## Option 4: Hybrid Approach (Generic SDLC + Custom Writing Tools)

### Description

Partial pivot: Drop custom SDLC framework, focus on writing quality differentiation only:
- **SDLC**: Adopt generic templates (GitHub repos, Atlassian templates, adapt as needed)
- **Writing Quality**: Keep custom framework (3 writing agents, validation rules, banned patterns, examples)
- **Tooling**: Simplify CLI to writing tools only (validation, prompt optimization, content diversification)
- **Distribution**: GitHub repository for writing tools, link to generic SDLC resources

**Philosophy**: "Specialize on writing, outsource SDLC" - compete on unique value (AI detection avoidance), leverage existing SDLC resources.

### Scoring Analysis

| Criterion | Score | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| **Cost** | 3.5 | **Moderate Development Cost**: 3-6 months to refactor (remove 58 SDLC agents, 42 commands, 150+ templates). **Ongoing**: 3-5 hours/week maintenance (smaller scope). **Budget**: $0 (GitHub-only). **Trade-off**: Less development than Option 1, but refactor cost upfront. |
| **Time to Value** | 4.0 | **Fast**: Writing tools ready now (already built), SDLC templates available externally (Atlassian, GitHub repos). **Validation**: 1-3 months (faster than full framework, since writing focus clearer). **Speed**: Simpler value proposition (just writing quality, not dual-purpose). |
| **Risk** | 4.0 | **Lower Risk**: Smaller scope (easier to validate), clearer positioning (writing-only), reduced support burden (fewer components). **Market Risk**: Writing-only tools face competition (AI detection tools exist). **Gap Risk**: Lose SDLC differentiation (no longer unique dual-purpose framework). |
| **Fit with Priorities** | 3.5 | **Partial Fit**: Addresses writing quality mission (AI authenticity), but abandons SDLC structure mission. **Gap**: No comprehensive lifecycle support, no multi-agent SDLC orchestration. **Trade-off**: Narrower focus (easier to excel) vs broader vision (underserved dual need). |
| **Strategic Benefits** | 3.0 | **Moderate Strategic Position**: Differentiated on writing (AI detection focus), but generic on SDLC (commodity templates). **Upside**: Clearer niche (writing-only tools), lower complexity (easier to maintain). **Downside**: Loses unique dual-purpose positioning, smaller addressable market (writers only, not agentic developers). |

### Benefits

1. **Focused Differentiation**: Specialize on writing quality (unique value), outsource SDLC (commodity)
2. **Simpler Value Proposition**: "AI Writing Guide" (not "AI Writing Guide + SDLC Complete")
3. **Lower Maintenance**: 3 agents + writing tools vs 61 agents + 45 commands + 156 templates
4. **Faster Validation**: Clearer target audience (writers, content creators) vs dual audience (writers + developers)
5. **Competitive Positioning**: Writing-focused tools face less direct competition than full SDLC frameworks

### Costs & Investment

**Refactor Time**:
- Remove 58 SDLC agents, 42 commands, 150+ templates: 40-60 hours
- Simplify CLI to writing tools only: 10-20 hours
- Update documentation (README, guides): 10-20 hours
- **Total**: 60-100 hours (3-6 months part-time)

**Ongoing Maintenance**: 3-5 hours/week (smaller scope than Option 1)

**Budget**: $0 (GitHub-only)

**Opportunity Cost**: Abandons 3 months SDLC framework development (~200-300 hours invested)

### Risks & Mitigation

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|------------|
| **Lose SDLC Differentiation** | Certain | Medium | **Trade-off**: Focus on writing (unique) vs SDLC (generic). **Impact**: Smaller addressable market (writers only, not developers). **Mitigation**: Accept narrower niche, double down on writing quality excellence. |
| **Writing-Only Competition** | High | Medium | **Competitors**: AI detection tools (GPTZero, Originality.ai), generic writing guides. **Differentiation**: Preventive (not reactive), agent-based validation, LLM-optimized prompts. **Risk**: May not be defensible moat. |
| **Sunk Cost Trap** | Medium | Low | **Psychology**: Already invested 3 months in SDLC framework. **Risk**: Emotional attachment to sunk costs. **Mitigation**: Data-driven decision (if writing tools gain traction, SDLC doesn't → pivot justified). |
| **Market Uncertainty** | Medium | High | **Unknown**: Is writing-only market large enough? Do users want SDLC integration? **Validation Needed**: Test writing tools independently before committing to refactor. |

### When This Makes Sense

**Pivot Triggers** (from Option 1):
1. **Low SDLC Adoption**: If Phase 1 validation (0-3 months) shows writing tools gaining traction but SDLC framework ignored → Focus on differentiated value (writing)
2. **Support Capacity Overwhelmed**: If full framework (61 agents + 45 commands) exceeds solo developer capacity (>15 hours/week) → Reduce scope to core value (writing tools)
3. **Competitive Pressure**: If platform vendors (Anthropic, OpenAI) launch native SDLC features → Differentiate on writing (cannot compete on SDLC), abandon commodity
4. **Community Signal**: If GitHub stars/issues/PRs focus on writing tools (ignore SDLC) → Follow user interest

**Advantages Over Option 1**:
- Simpler (easier to maintain)
- Clearer value proposition (writing-only)
- Lower risk (smaller scope to validate)
- Faster iteration (fewer components to coordinate)

**Disadvantages vs Option 1**:
- Narrower market (writers only, not developers)
- Less differentiation (writing tools face competition, SDLC was unique)
- Abandons 3 months investment (sunk cost)
- Loses dual-purpose synergy (writing + SDLC integration)

---

## Recommendation: Option 1 (Continue Development)

### Decision Rationale

**Weighted Score Analysis**:
- **Option 1** (Continue Development): 3.70
- **Option 2** (Adopt Existing Tools): 3.70 ← **TIE**, broken by qualitative factors below
- **Option 3** (Manual Only): 2.35 ← **Not viable** (opposes core mission)
- **Option 4** (Hybrid): 3.65 ← **Close alternative** (fallback option)

**Tie-Breaker: Option 1 vs Option 2** (equal weighted scores):

**Option 1 wins** on qualitative factors:
1. **Strategic Fit**: Option 1 addresses BOTH missions (writing + SDLC), Option 2 addresses SDLC only (ignores writing quality)
2. **Differentiation**: Option 1 unique positioning (only LLM-first dual-purpose framework), Option 2 commodity (Jira/Confluence ubiquitous)
3. **Zero Budget Constraint**: Option 1 sustainable ($0 forever), Option 2 requires paid tiers at scale ($140+/month for 10 users)
4. **Community Ownership**: Option 1 extensible (MIT license, community can fork/contribute), Option 2 vendor-controlled (cannot improve platform)
5. **Sunk Cost Recovery**: Option 1 leverages 3 months investment (485 files, 105 commits), Option 2 abandons entirely

**Why Not Option 4 (Hybrid)?**
- **Premature Optimization**: No validation data yet (0 users). **Risk**: Pivot before testing full framework.
- **Sunk Cost**: Already built SDLC framework (3 months, 58 agents, 156 templates). **Rationale**: Test first, pivot if data shows SDLC ignored.
- **Dual-Purpose Synergy**: Writing + SDLC integration is unique positioning. **Loss**: Hybrid abandons differentiation.
- **Ship-Now Mindset**: Launch full framework, iterate based on feedback. **Flexibility**: Can pivot to Option 4 later if data supports.

### Success Criteria (Revisit Decision)

**Green (Continue Option 1)**: Proceed if any of these thresholds met by 3 months:
- 5+ GitHub stars
- 3+ active issues/PRs
- 2+ users complete Inception → Elaboration cycle
- Community engagement (discussions, feedback, testimonials)

**Yellow (Consider Option 4)**: Reassess if:
- <5 stars after 3 months AND writing tools show interest (articles, social media) BUT SDLC ignored
- Support burden >10 hours/week (SDLC questions dominate) BUT writing tools low-effort

**Red (Pivot to Option 4 immediately)**: Trigger if:
- Support >20 hours/week for 4+ consecutive weeks (unsustainable)
- 10+ critical issues unresolved >2 weeks (quality crisis)
- Negative feedback patterns (users report "SDLC overwhelming" BUT writing tools praised)

### Fallback Strategy

**If Option 1 Fails** (triggers above):

**Immediate Pivot to Option 4** (Hybrid):
1. Archive SDLC framework (mark deprecated, preserve in Git history)
2. Simplify CLI to writing tools only (`aiwg-validate`, `aiwg-optimize-prompt`)
3. Link to generic SDLC resources (Atlassian templates, GitHub repos)
4. Update README/docs to writing-only positioning
5. Reduce maintenance to 3-5 hours/week (smaller scope)

**Rationale**: Option 4 recovers writing tools value (unique), cuts SDLC maintenance burden (commodity), preserves zero-budget sustainability.

**Timeline**: 3 months validation → decision point → 2-3 months pivot if needed

### Implementation Plan (Option 1)

**Phase 1 - Validation (0-3 months)**:
1. **Launch** (Week 1): Publish GitHub repository, announce on social media (Reddit, Hacker News, Twitter)
2. **Early Adopters** (Weeks 2-8): Recruit 5-10 testers (personal network, online communities), provide support
3. **Feedback Loop** (Weeks 9-12): Iterate based on user reports (fix bugs, clarify docs, adjust workflows)
4. **Metrics** (Week 12): Evaluate success criteria (stars, issues, usage, testimonials)
5. **Decision Point** (Week 12): Green (continue) / Yellow (consider hybrid) / Red (pivot immediately)

**Phase 2 - Growth (3-6 months)** (if Phase 1 succeeds):
1. **Community Infrastructure**: FAQs, discussions, contributor guidelines
2. **Feature Expansion**: Based on feedback (new templates, agents, commands)
3. **Metrics**: 25-50 stars, 1-2 regular contributors, 10-20 projects with `.aiwg/` artifacts

**Phase 3 - Scale (6-12 months)** (if Phase 2 succeeds):
1. **Performance Optimization**: Caching, incremental processing, context optimization
2. **Platform Integrations**: Advanced multi-platform abstraction (Cursor, Codex)
3. **Metrics**: 100+ stars, 2-3 regular contributors, 50+ active users

**Sustainability**: 5-10 hours/week maintenance (issue triage, PR review, docs)

**Review Questions for Stakeholders**:
1. **Product Strategist**: Does Option 1 positioning (dual-purpose framework) resonate with target market? Or is Option 4 (writing-only) clearer value proposition?
2. **System Analyst**: Are Option 1 risks adequately mitigated? Is 6-12 month timeline realistic for solo developer?
3. **Solo Developer**: Does Option 1 align with personal goals (learning, portfolio, impact)? Is volunteer time commitment (5-10 hours/week) sustainable?
4. **All**: Are pivot triggers (Option 1 → Option 4) clear and measurable? Would you recognize when to pivot?

**Assumptions Validated**:
- Weighted scoring methodology derived from Vision Document priorities
- Option 2 (Adopt Existing) scored fairly despite core mission mismatch (objective analysis)
- Option 3 (Manual Only) included for completeness (despite being non-viable baseline)
- Option 4 (Hybrid) positioned as fallback (not immediate choice, but data-driven pivot option)
