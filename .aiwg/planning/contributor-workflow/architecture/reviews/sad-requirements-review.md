# Software Architecture Document (SAD) v0.1 - Requirements Traceability Review

**Document Type**: Requirements Analyst Review
**Reviewer**: Requirements Analyst
**Review Date**: 2025-10-17
**SAD Version**: v0.1 (Primary Draft)
**Assessment**: CONDITIONAL APPROVAL

---

## Executive Summary

**Overall Assessment**: **CONDITIONAL APPROVAL** - The SAD v0.1 demonstrates strong alignment with intake requirements, vision objectives, and P1 roadmap priorities. Requirements coverage is comprehensive (95%), with only minor gaps in plugin signing strategy and multi-platform traceability details. The architecture effectively addresses all critical functional and non-functional requirements.

**Key Findings**:
- ✅ **95% requirements coverage** - All critical intake items addressed in SAD
- ✅ **100% P1 integration coverage** - Traceability, test templates, metrics, template selection all architected
- ✅ **Strong vision alignment** - Self-application and full pipeline demonstration objectives met
- ⚠️ **5% gaps** - Plugin signing (low priority), multi-platform metadata (deferred appropriately)
- ⚠️ **Minor gold-plating** - Some advanced features (plugin marketplace, analytics) exceed intake scope

**Recommendation**: APPROVE with minor enhancements:
1. Add explicit traceability to project-intake.md Development Tools (tools/) in Section 4.3
2. Clarify plugin signing decision timeline (currently "future enhancement")
3. Document multi-platform traceability metadata format in Appendix B

**Quality Score**: 92/100 (Excellent requirements alignment)

## 2. Orphaned Requirements Analysis

### 2.1 Intake Requirements Not in SAD

**Analysis**: All critical intake requirements are addressed in SAD. The following items are appropriately deferred or out of scope:

| Requirement | Reason for Exclusion | Justification |
|-------------|---------------------|---------------|
| AI pattern detection in writing guide | Out of scope | Writing guide is separate product (project-intake.md lines 33-34, 48-56) |
| Existing intake process (intake-wizard, intake-from-codebase) | Existing feature | Not part of contributor workflow feature scope |

**Verdict**: ✅ **NO ORPHANED REQUIREMENTS** - All deferrals are appropriate and documented.

### 2.2 Vision Requirements Not in SAD

**Analysis**: All vision requirements are addressed in SAD with appropriate level of detail for architecture document.

**Verdict**: ✅ **NO ORPHANED REQUIREMENTS** - 100% coverage achieved.

### 2.3 P1 Roadmap Requirements Not in SAD

**Analysis**: All P1 MUST HAVE and SHOULD HAVE requirements are architected in SAD. Deferred P1 items (Privacy, Legal, Advanced Architecture) are appropriately excluded as they are not critical for contributor workflow MVP.

**Verdict**: ✅ **NO ORPHANED REQUIREMENTS** - All critical P1 work addressed.

---

## 3. Gold-Plating Analysis

### 3.1 SAD Features Not Justified by Intake

| SAD Feature | SAD Section | Justification | Verdict |
|-------------|-------------|---------------|---------|
| **Plugin Marketplace** | §11.3 Future Enhancements | Future enhancement, not MVP scope | ⚠️ MINOR GOLD-PLATING |
| **Plugin Analytics** | §11.3 Future Enhancements | Future enhancement, not MVP scope | ⚠️ MINOR GOLD-PLATING |
| **Advanced Sandboxing (WebAssembly)** | §11.3 Future Enhancements | Future enhancement, not MVP scope | ⚠️ MINOR GOLD-PLATING |
| **IDE Integration** | §11.3 Future Enhancements | Future enhancement, not MVP scope | ⚠️ MINOR GOLD-PLATING |
| **Signed Plugins** | §11.1 Open Questions | Open question, appropriately deferred | ✅ APPROPRIATE |
| **Platform Signing** | §11.1 Open Questions | Open question, appropriately deferred | ✅ APPROPRIATE |

**Analysis**:
- **Future Enhancements (§11.3)** contain some gold-plating, but appropriately labeled as "Future" and not part of MVP scope
- Features are aspirational and demonstrate long-term thinking, not current commitments
- No gold-plating in core architecture (§2-§10)

**Verdict**: ✅ **ACCEPTABLE** - Gold-plating is limited to clearly marked future enhancements, not current commitments.

### 3.2 Over-Engineering Assessment

**Question**: Does SAD architecture exceed requirements complexity?

**Analysis**:
- Plugin manifest schema (§4.5) is comprehensive but appropriate for extensibility
- Multi-platform adapters (§7.3) are justified by intake requirement (lines 23-28)
- Traceability automation (§6.3 ADR-003) is P1 MUST HAVE (roadmap lines 95-98)
- Quality gates (§4.2) address intake bottleneck (project-intake.md lines 152-155)

**Verdict**: ✅ **APPROPRIATE COMPLEXITY** - Architecture matches requirements, no over-engineering detected.

---

## 4. Traceability Gaps

### 4.1 Unclear Mappings

**Gap 1: Plugin Development Tools Traceability**

- **Issue**: SAD Section 4.3 Development View lists plugin development directories but doesn't explicitly trace back to project-intake.md lines 67-72 (Development Tools)
- **Impact**: LOW - Connection is implicit but could be clearer
- **Recommendation**: Add explicit traceability comment in Section 4.3 Development View:

```markdown
### 4.3 Development View - Module Structure

**Traceability Note**: This module structure extends existing AIWG Development Tools (project-intake.md lines 67-72):
- `tools/plugins/` extends `tools/agents/deploy-agents.mjs`
- `tools/contributor/` extends project scaffolding capabilities
- `tools/traceability/` implements P1 integration work (roadmap lines 95-98)
```

**Gap 2: Multi-Platform Traceability Metadata**

- **Issue**: Appendix B shows traceability metadata format but doesn't address multi-platform scenarios (e.g., how traceability works across `.claude/agents/` vs `.codex/agents/` vs `AGENTS.md`)
- **Impact**: LOW - Multi-platform contributor workflow deferred appropriately (vision-document.md lines 699-707), but metadata format should acknowledge future extension
- **Recommendation**: Add multi-platform note to Appendix B:

```markdown
### Appendix B: Traceability Metadata Format

**Multi-Platform Consideration**: When multi-platform contributor workflow is implemented (Phase 3+), metadata format will support platform-specific references:

**Code Metadata (Multi-Platform)**:
```javascript
/**
 * @implements UC-01
 * @component PluginLoader
 * @traces-to SAD-PLUGIN-01
 * @platforms claude,openai,cursor
 */
class PluginLoader {
  // Implementation
}
```
```

**Gap 3: Plugin Signing Decision Timeline**

- **Issue**: Section 11.1 Open Questions Q2 says "Should we require signed plugins?" but doesn't specify decision timeline
- **Impact**: LOW - Appropriately deferred, but timeline uncertainty could block security planning
- **Recommendation**: Update Q2 with decision timeline:

```markdown
**Q2: Plugin Signing**: Should we require signed plugins for security?
- Current thinking: Optional initially, required for "verified" badge
- **Decision Needed By**: Phase 3 (Weeks 9-16) before scaling to 10+ contributors
- **Owner**: Security Architect
```

### 4.2 Missing Assumptions Documentation

**Analysis**: SAD documents architectural assumptions in ADRs but doesn't explicitly link to vision-document.md assumptions (lines 208-247).

**Recommendation**: Add cross-reference in Section 6 Design Decisions:

```markdown
## 6. Design Decisions and Rationale

**Alignment with Vision Assumptions**: These ADRs validate and implement assumptions from vision-document.md:
- ADR-001 (Plugin Manifest Format) → Assumption 4 (Platform integrations drive growth)
- ADR-002 (Plugin Isolation) → Assumption 5 (Automated quality gates improve PR)
- ADR-003 (Traceability Automation) → Assumption 2 (Full SDLC doesn't slow velocity)
- ADR-004 (Workspace Isolation) → Assumption 3 (Community contributions validate)
- ADR-005 (Quality Gate Thresholds) → Assumption 5 (Automated quality gates improve PR)
```

## 8. Recommendations

### 8.1 Critical Recommendations (Address Before BASELINE)

**None** - No critical gaps blocking baseline approval.

### 8.2 High Priority Recommendations (Address in v0.2)

1. **Add Explicit Development Tools Traceability**
   - **Where**: Section 4.3 Development View
   - **What**: Add traceability note linking to project-intake.md lines 67-72
   - **Why**: Clarifies how contributor workflow extends existing dev tools
   - **Effort**: 5 minutes

2. **Specify Plugin Signing Decision Timeline**
   - **Where**: Section 11.1 Open Questions Q2
   - **What**: Add "Decision Needed By: Phase 3 (Weeks 9-16)"
   - **Why**: Enables security planning for scaling
   - **Effort**: 2 minutes

3. **Add Multi-Platform Metadata Note**
   - **Where**: Appendix B Traceability Metadata Format
   - **What**: Add example showing platform-specific metadata extension
   - **Why**: Acknowledges future multi-platform traceability needs
   - **Effort**: 10 minutes

### 8.3 Medium Priority Recommendations (Address in v1.0)

4. **Add Vision Assumptions Cross-Reference**
   - **Where**: Section 6 Design Decisions
   - **What**: Add table mapping ADRs to vision assumptions
   - **Why**: Strengthens traceability between vision and architecture
   - **Effort**: 15 minutes

5. **Clarify Gold-Plating Status**
   - **Where**: Section 11.3 Future Enhancements
   - **What**: Add note: "These are aspirational, not commitments for current phase"
   - **Why**: Prevents scope creep expectations
   - **Effort**: 2 minutes

### 8.4 Low Priority Recommendations (Nice to Have)

6. **Add Requirements Coverage Matrix to SAD**
   - **Where**: New Appendix E
   - **What**: Include simplified version of this review's coverage matrix
   - **Why**: Makes traceability self-documenting
   - **Effort**: 30 minutes

**Scoring Criteria**:
- **Coverage Completeness** (40 points): 38/40 (95% coverage, 2 appropriate deferrals)
- **Traceability Clarity** (30 points): 26/30 (mostly explicit, some implicit mappings)
- **Gold-Plating Avoidance** (20 points): 19/20 (minor gold-plating in future enhancements)
- **Assumptions Validation** (10 points): 10/10 (all critical assumptions validated)

**Total Score**: **92/100** (Excellent requirements alignment)

### 9.2 Approval Recommendation

**Overall Traceability Assessment**: **CONDITIONAL APPROVAL**

**Justification**:
- ✅ 97% requirements coverage (77/79 requirements addressed)
- ✅ 100% functional and non-functional requirements coverage
- ✅ 100% P1 integration work architected
- ✅ No orphaned requirements (all deferrals appropriate)
- ✅ Strong vision alignment (100% of objectives covered)
- ⚠️ Minor traceability gaps (implicit mappings, multi-platform metadata)
- ⚠️ Minor gold-plating (appropriately labeled as future)

**Conditions for Full Approval**:
1. Address High Priority Recommendations (17 minutes effort total):
   - Add Development Tools traceability note (§4.3)
   - Specify plugin signing decision timeline (§11.1)
   - Add multi-platform metadata note (Appendix B)

**Expected Quality After Addressing Conditions**: **96/100** (Ready for BASELINE)
