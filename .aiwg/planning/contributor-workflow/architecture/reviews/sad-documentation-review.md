---

## 4. Consistency Assessment

**Score:** 87/100

### 4.1 Terminology Consistency

**Generally Excellent:**
- "Plugin" used consistently (not "plug-in" or "extension")
- "AIWG" used throughout
- "Quality gates" standardized
- "Contributor workflow" vs "contribution workflow" used consistently

**Inconsistencies Identified (3):**

1. **Line 143 vs Line 258:**
   - Line 143: "Agents" (plural, generic)
   - Line 258: "Agents/" (directory name)
   - **Fix:** Use "Agent Definitions" for clarity in line 143

2. **Line 40 vs Line 127:**
   - Line 40: "Solo Maintainer" (capitalized)
   - Line 127: "maintainer" (lowercase)
   - **Fix:** Standardize on lowercase except in headings

3. **Line 62 vs Line 299:**
   - Line 62: "Sandbox" (in diagram)
   - Line 299: "PluginSandbox" (class name)
   - **Acceptable variation** (diagram simplification vs. code name), but consider adding note: "Sandbox (PluginSandbox)"

### 4.2 Formatting Consistency

**Code Blocks:**
- **Mostly consistent** use of language tags (```yaml, ```mermaid, ```javascript)
- **Minor issue:** Line 230 - directory tree uses ``` without language tag (should be ```text or ```bash)
- **Minor issue:** Line 880 - plugin structure uses ``` without tag (should be ```text)

**Lists:**
- **Excellent parallel structure** in bulleted lists
- **Consistent** use of "**Bold**:" for term definitions
- **Good** use of table formatting for requirements and risks

**Tables:**
- All tables have headers (good)
- Column alignment consistent
- One minor issue: Line 743 table has "Component" but line 753 has "Component" (same, but check spacing)

### 4.3 File Path and Reference Consistency

**Strong:**
- Consistent use of backticks for file paths
- Relative paths used appropriately
- Git-style paths (forward slashes)

**Minor issue:**
- Line 1220: `.aiwg/intake/project-intake.md` vs Line 263: `.aiwg-plugins/` (different root directories)
- **Clarification needed:** Are `.aiwg/` and `.aiwg-plugins/` both at project root? Consider brief explanation in section 4.3.

**Complete Coverage:**
- ✅ Logical View (Plugin System)
- ✅ Process View (Contributor Workflow)
- ✅ Development View (Module Structure)
- ✅ Deployment View (System Topology)
- ✅ Data View (Plugin Manifest Schema)

**Suggested Addition:**
- **Physical View:** While deployment view covers topology, consider adding hardware/cloud requirements (e.g., "Developer machine: 8GB RAM, 10GB disk space")

### 5.2 Component Documentation

**Comprehensive:**
- All major components described
- Clear responsibility definitions
- Good interface documentation (class diagram)

**Minor Gap:**
- "Metrics Collector" (line 74) shown in diagram but not detailed in component descriptions
- "Template Selector" (line 75) shown but lacks detailed explanation

### 5.3 ADR Documentation

**Excellent:**
- 5 ADRs covering critical decisions
- All ADRs follow consistent format (Status, Context, Decision, Rationale, Alternatives, Consequences)
- Good balance of technical and strategic decisions

**Suggestion:**
- ADR-002 (Plugin Isolation) states "Plugins operate on files... not runtime code" - Consider adding ADR for "No Plugin Code Execution" as explicit security decision

### 5.4 Appendices

**Strong Supporting Material:**
- Appendix A: Plugin Manifest JSON Schema (comprehensive)
- Appendix B: Traceability Metadata Format (clear examples)
- Appendix C: Quality Gate Configuration (concrete example)
- Appendix D: Reference Implementation Links (helpful)

```

**Rationale:** Improves accessibility for new readers; standard technical writing practice.

---

## 8. Strategic Recommendations

### 8.1 Consider Adding Security Architecture Section

**Observation:** Security is well-covered in ADR-002 and Quality Tactics (8.2), but lacks dedicated architectural view.

**Recommendation:** Add "4.6 Security View" with:
- Threat model overview
- Trust boundaries diagram
- Security control mapping
- Plugin permission model details

**Rationale:** Given security criticality (lines 41-42, 799), dedicated section warranted.

---

### 8.2 Expand Performance Benchmarks

**Observation:** Targets stated (e.g., <5s installation, <30s quality gates) but no baseline or measurement plan.

**Recommendation:** Add "Appendix F: Performance Benchmarks" with:
- Current baseline measurements (if available)
- Test methodology
- Acceptance criteria
- Performance test scenarios

**Rationale:** Makes NFRs (Section 3.2) more actionable and verifiable.

---

### 8.3 Add Implementation Phases

**Observation:** Implementation guidelines (Section 10) are comprehensive but lack phasing.

**Recommendation:** Add "10.4 Implementation Phases" showing:
- Phase 1: Core plugin system (manifest, loader, registry)
- Phase 2: Contributor workflow (fork manager, quality gates)
- Phase 3: P1 Integration (traceability, metrics)

**Rationale:** Aligns with Inception roadmap; provides implementation sequencing.
