# Testability Review - Software Architecture Document v0.1

**Reviewer**: Test Architect
**Document**: SAD v0.1 - AIWG Contributor Workflow & Plugin System
**Review Date**: 2025-10-17
**Review Status**: CONDITIONAL APPROVAL

---

## Executive Summary

**Overall Testability Assessment**: CONDITIONAL APPROVAL (86/100)

The Software Architecture Document demonstrates strong testability fundamentals with clear component boundaries, well-defined interfaces, and explicit quality targets. The plugin system's filesystem-based isolation and manifest-driven approach provides excellent test surface area. However, critical gaps exist in performance testing strategy, integration test orchestration, and end-to-end workflow validation.

**Key Strengths**:
- Clear separation of concerns enabling unit test isolation
- Manifest-driven validation with JSON schema provides concrete test criteria
- Quality gate thresholds (80/100) are measurable and automatable
- Traceability metadata format enables automated verification
- Plugin isolation strategy simplifies mocking and stubbing

**Critical Gaps** (must address for APPROVED status):
1. **No explicit integration test orchestration strategy** for multi-component workflows
2. **Missing performance test baseline data** - NFR targets lack current state comparison
3. **No test data management strategy** for plugin manifests, fixtures, and mocks
4. **Insufficient error scenario coverage** in runtime scenarios

**Recommended Actions**:
- Define integration test execution framework and orchestration patterns
- Establish performance baselines before implementation begins
- Create comprehensive test data catalog with fixtures for each plugin type
- Document negative test scenarios for each major workflow

## 1. Plugin System Testability Analysis

### 1.1 PluginRegistry Testability: 92/100

**Strengths**:
- Pure data operations (discovery, registration, search) are highly testable
- Clear input/output contracts for all methods
- No side effects in core operations
- GitHub API abstraction enables clean mocking

**Test Coverage Strategy**:

```javascript
describe('PluginRegistry', () => {
  describe('discover()', () => {
    it('should discover plugins from GitHub topics');
    it('should discover plugins from local .aiwg-plugins/');
    it('should discover plugins from npm registry');
    it('should handle network failures gracefully');
    it('should cache discovery results');
    it('should invalidate cache on explicit refresh');
  });

  describe('register()', () => {
    it('should register valid plugin manifests');
    it('should reject malformed manifests');
    it('should detect duplicate plugin names');
    it('should validate semantic versioning');
  });

  describe('search()', () => {
    it('should search by plugin name');
    it('should search by tags');
    it('should search by type (platform, compliance, etc.)');
    it('should rank results by relevance');
  });
});
```

**Mock Strategy**:
- **GitHub API**: Mock with `nock` or similar HTTP interceptor
- **Filesystem operations**: Use `mock-fs` for in-memory filesystem
- **Cache layer**: Inject mock cache provider

**Gaps**:
- ⚠️ No specification for cache invalidation testing
- ⚠️ Search ranking algorithm not defined (impacts test assertions)

**Recommendation**: Define cache TTL and search ranking criteria explicitly in architecture.

### 1.2 PluginLoader Testability: 88/100

**Strengths**:
- Clear verification steps (signature, dependencies, compatibility)
- Download operations can be stubbed with test fixtures
- Dependency resolution is deterministic

**Test Coverage Strategy**:

```javascript
describe('PluginLoader', () => {
  describe('load()', () => {
    it('should load plugin from local path');
    it('should load plugin from GitHub release');
    it('should load plugin from npm package');
    it('should validate plugin structure before loading');
    it('should timeout on slow downloads');
  });

  describe('verify()', () => {
    it('should accept valid plugin signatures');
    it('should reject unsigned plugins when signing required');
    it('should detect tampered plugin content');
    it('should validate plugin.yaml against JSON schema');
  });

  describe('checkDependencies()', () => {
    it('should resolve all dependencies');
    it('should detect circular dependencies');
    it('should handle missing dependencies');
    it('should validate version compatibility');
    it('should suggest dependency installation order');
  });
});
```

**Test Data Requirements**:
- **Valid plugin packages**: 5 types (platform, compliance, vertical, workflow, standards)
- **Malformed manifests**: 10+ error cases (missing fields, invalid syntax, schema violations)
- **Dependency scenarios**: Simple, complex, circular, conflicting
- **Download scenarios**: Success, timeout, network error, partial download

**Gaps**:
- ⚠️ No specification for download timeout values (impacts test determinism)
- ⚠️ Plugin signature format not defined (blocks signature verification tests)

**Recommendation**: Define plugin signing approach in ADR-002 revision or new ADR.

### 1.3 PluginManager Testability: 85/100

**Strengths**:
- State machine lifecycle (install → activate → deactivate → update → remove) is testable
- Filesystem operations are isolated and mockable
- Hook execution is observable

**Test Coverage Strategy**:

```javascript
describe('PluginManager', () => {
  describe('install()', () => {
    it('should install plugin to .aiwg-plugins/');
    it('should update installed.json registry');
    it('should execute post_install hook');
    it('should rollback on installation failure');
    it('should handle concurrent installations');
  });

  describe('activate()', () => {
    it('should deploy agents to .claude/agents/');
    it('should deploy commands to .claude/commands/');
    it('should inject content into CLAUDE.md');
    it('should skip activation if already active');
    it('should validate platform compatibility before activation');
  });

  describe('runHook()', () => {
    it('should execute lifecycle hooks');
    it('should capture hook stdout/stderr');
    it('should timeout long-running hooks');
    it('should isolate hook execution environment');
    it('should pass plugin context to hooks');
  });
});
```

**Integration Test Requirements**:
- **End-to-end install flow**: Registry discovery → Loader download → Manager install → Activate
- **Multi-plugin scenarios**: Install 3+ plugins with dependencies
- **Failure recovery**: Installation fails mid-process, verify rollback
- **Concurrent operations**: Install plugin A while updating plugin B

**Gaps**:
- ❌ **CRITICAL**: No specification for rollback strategy (what gets reverted on failure?)
- ⚠️ Hook execution timeout not specified
- ⚠️ Concurrent operation safety not addressed in architecture

**Recommendation**: Add ADR for rollback strategy and concurrency control.

### 1.4 PluginSandbox Testability: 78/100

**Strengths**:
- Filesystem isolation is straightforward to validate
- Permission checks are binary (allow/deny)
- No complex runtime state

**Test Coverage Strategy**:

```javascript
describe('PluginSandbox', () => {
  describe('isolate()', () => {
    it('should restrict plugin to designated directories');
    it('should prevent access to parent directories');
    it('should allow read from plugin directory');
    it('should allow write to .aiwg/plugins/ only');
  });

  describe('checkPermissions()', () => {
    it('should allow reading plugin manifest');
    it('should deny writing to AIWG core files');
    it('should deny access to sensitive directories');
    it('should deny network operations');
  });

  describe('validateAccess()', () => {
    it('should log all access attempts');
    it('should enforce whitelist of allowed operations');
    it('should prevent path traversal attacks');
  });
});
```

**Security Test Requirements**:
- **Path traversal**: Attempt `../../etc/passwd` access
- **Symlink following**: Create symlink to sensitive file
- **Race conditions**: TOCTOU (Time-Of-Check-Time-Of-Use) attacks
- **Resource exhaustion**: Large file writes, infinite loops in hooks

**Gaps**:
- ❌ **CRITICAL**: ADR-002 mentions "no runtime execution" but hooks DO execute scripts
- ⚠️ No specification for resource limits (disk space, CPU time, memory)
- ⚠️ Security audit process not defined

**Recommendation**: Revise ADR-002 to clarify hook execution security model. Add resource limits.

### 1.5 Plugin Installation Scenario: Integration Test

**Scenario Coverage** (from SAD Section 5.1):

```gherkin
Feature: Platform Integration Plugin Installation
  Scenario: Developer installs Cursor plugin
    Given AIWG CLI is installed
    When developer runs "aiwg -install-plugin cursor-integration"
    Then plugin is discovered in registry
    And plugin manifest is validated
    And dependencies are checked
    And plugin is downloaded to .aiwg-plugins/
    And post_install hook executes
    And agents are deployed to .cursor/agents/
    And CLAUDE.md is updated with Cursor guidance
    And installation completes in <5 seconds

  Scenario: Installation fails due to missing dependency
    Given AIWG CLI is installed
    When developer runs "aiwg -install-plugin cursor-integration"
    And dependency "warp-terminal" is not installed
    Then installation is blocked
    And clear error message suggests installing dependency
    And no partial installation artifacts remain

  Scenario: Installation fails mid-process
    Given AIWG CLI is installed
    When developer runs "aiwg -install-plugin cursor-integration"
    And post_install hook fails
    Then all changes are rolled back
    And .aiwg-plugins/ is cleaned up
    And installed.json is not updated
    And CLAUDE.md is unchanged
```

**Test Automation**:
- Use `tmp-promise` for temporary test directories
- Mock GitHub API with `nock` for deterministic downloads
- Capture filesystem state before/after for rollback verification
- Measure execution time with `performance.now()` for <5s validation

**Gaps**:
- ⚠️ No specification for partial state detection (how to know rollback is needed?)
- ⚠️ <5s performance target may be unrealistic with network operations (needs baseline)

---

## 2. Quality Gates Architecture Testability

### 2.1 Quality Gate Validation: 90/100

**ADR-005 Analysis**: 80/100 minimum threshold is testable and practical.

**Strengths**:
- Clear weighted scoring model (Appendix C)
- Objective criteria (markdown lint rules, manifest schema)
- Configuration-driven (quality-gates.yaml)

**Test Coverage Strategy**:

```javascript
describe('QualityGates', () => {
  describe('run()', () => {
    it('should execute all enabled gates');
    it('should calculate weighted score');
    it('should generate detailed report');
    it('should complete in <30 seconds');
  });

  describe('markdownLint()', () => {
    it('should validate against MD001-MD047 rules');
    it('should respect exceptions (MD033, MD013)');
    it('should score 0/25 for failing files');
    it('should score 25/25 for passing files');
    it('should provide line-by-line error details');
  });

  describe('manifestSync()', () => {
    it('should detect missing files referenced in manifest');
    it('should validate JSON schema compliance');
    it('should check dependency resolution');
    it('should score proportionally to errors found');
  });

  describe('calculateScore()', () => {
    it('should weight gates correctly (sum to 100)');
    it('should threshold at 80 for pass/fail');
    it('should handle partial gate failures');
    it('should round to integer scores');
  });
});
```

**Edge Cases**:

```javascript
describe('Quality Gate Edge Cases', () => {
  it('should handle workspace with no markdown files');
  it('should handle empty manifest (minimal plugin)');
  it('should handle plugins with no dependencies');
  it('should handle disabled gates (weight redistribution)');
  it('should handle gate execution timeout');
  it('should handle gate crash (exception handling)');
});
```

**Performance Testing**:

```javascript
describe('Quality Gate Performance', () => {
  it('should complete small plugin (<10 files) in <5s');
  it('should complete medium plugin (50 files) in <15s');
  it('should complete large plugin (200 files) in <30s');
  it('should run gates in parallel when possible');
  it('should cache results for unchanged files');
});
```

**Gaps**:
- ⚠️ No specification for gate timeout behavior (fail gate? skip gate? overall timeout?)
- ⚠️ Weight redistribution for disabled gates not documented
- ⚠️ <30s overall target needs breakdown by gate (how much per gate?)

**Recommendation**: Document timeout strategy and per-gate performance budgets.

### 2.2 Metrics Collection Testability: 82/100

**Strengths**:
- Asynchronous collection (NFR-05) prevents blocking
- Clear metric types: velocity, quality, DORA

**Test Coverage Strategy**:

```javascript
describe('MetricsCollector', () => {
  describe('velocity-tracker', () => {
    it('should track commits per day/week/month');
    it('should track PRs opened/merged/closed');
    it('should calculate cycle time (PR open → merge)');
    it('should detect contributor growth trends');
  });

  describe('quality-metrics', () => {
    it('should track quality scores over time');
    it('should identify quality trend (improving/declining)');
    it('should correlate quality with contributor experience');
  });

  describe('dora-metrics', () => {
    it('should calculate deployment frequency');
    it('should calculate lead time for changes');
    it('should calculate mean time to recovery');
    it('should calculate change failure rate');
  });
});
```

**Test Data Requirements**:
- **Git history fixtures**: 30+ commits across 10 contributors
- **PR data fixtures**: 50+ PRs with various states (open, merged, closed)
- **Quality report fixtures**: 20+ quality scores spanning 3 months
- **Deployment data**: 10+ deployments with success/failure outcomes

**Gaps**:
- ⚠️ No specification for metric aggregation intervals (daily? weekly?)
- ⚠️ No specification for data retention (how long to keep raw metrics?)
- ⚠️ Asynchronous collection error handling not addressed

**Recommendation**: Define metric retention policy and aggregation schedule.

### 2.3 Traceability Validation: 88/100

**Strengths**:
- Graph-based approach (NetworkX) is well-tested in other projects
- Metadata format (Appendix B) is parseable and verifiable
- Clear validation criteria: coverage, orphans, gaps

**Test Coverage Strategy**:

```javascript
describe('TraceabilityEngine', () => {
  describe('buildGraph()', () => {
    it('should parse requirement metadata');
    it('should parse architecture metadata');
    it('should parse code metadata (@implements, @traces-to)');
    it('should parse test metadata (@tests, @validates)');
    it('should construct dependency graph');
    it('should handle missing metadata gracefully');
  });

  describe('validate()', () => {
    it('should calculate traceability coverage %');
    it('should detect orphaned requirements');
    it('should detect untested code');
    it('should detect missing architecture links');
    it('should enforce 80% minimum coverage');
  });

  describe('impactAnalysis()', () => {
    it('should identify affected tests for code change');
    it('should identify affected docs for requirement change');
    it('should traverse dependency graph efficiently');
  });
});
```

**Integration Test Scenarios**:

```gherkin
Feature: Automated Traceability
  Scenario: Complete traceability chain
    Given requirement UC-01 exists
    And architecture SAD-PLUGIN-01 implements UC-01
    And code PluginLoader traces to SAD-PLUGIN-01
    And test suite validates UC-01
    When traceability check runs
    Then coverage is 100%
    And no orphans are detected

  Scenario: Orphaned requirement detected
    Given requirement UC-99 exists
    And no architecture implements UC-99
    When traceability check runs
    Then orphan UC-99 is reported
    And coverage is <100%
    And PR merge is blocked
```

**Performance Testing**:

```javascript
describe('Traceability Performance', () => {
  it('should build graph for 50 requirements in <10s');
  it('should build graph for 500 requirements in <60s');
  it('should cache graph for unchanged artifacts');
  it('should update graph incrementally on file change');
});
```

**Gaps**:
- ⚠️ No specification for graph caching strategy (when to invalidate?)
- ⚠️ No specification for incremental graph updates (full rebuild vs delta?)
- ⚠️ Python/Node.js interop testing not addressed (traceability is Python, CLI is Node)

**Recommendation**: Define graph caching and incremental update strategy. Test Python/Node bridge.

---

## 3. Contributor Workflow Testability

### 3.1 Fork Manager Testability: 80/100

**Strengths**:
- Workspace isolation in `.aiwg/contrib/{feature}/` is straightforward
- Directory operations are deterministic and fast

**Test Coverage Strategy**:

```javascript
describe('ForkManager', () => {
  describe('createWorkspace()', () => {
    it('should create isolated workspace');
    it('should copy plugin template');
    it('should initialize git branch');
    it('should prevent duplicate workspace names');
  });

  describe('cleanup()', () => {
    it('should remove workspace directory');
    it('should preserve git history');
    it('should handle concurrent cleanups');
  });
});
```

**End-to-End Workflow Test**:

```gherkin
Feature: Contributor Workspace Management
  Scenario: Create and cleanup workspace
    Given AIWG project exists
    When contributor runs "aiwg -contribute-start my-feature"
    Then workspace is created at .aiwg/contrib/my-feature/
    And plugin template is copied
    And git branch "contrib/my-feature" is created
    When contributor runs "aiwg -contribute-cleanup my-feature"
    Then workspace directory is removed
    And git branch is deleted
```

**Gaps**:
- ⚠️ No specification for workspace naming conflicts (what if feature exists?)
- ⚠️ No specification for workspace size limits (prevent disk exhaustion)
- ⚠️ Concurrent workspace creation safety not addressed

**Recommendation**: Add workspace conflict resolution and size limits.

### 3.2 PR Automation Testability: 85/100

**Strengths**:
- GitHub CLI (`gh`) abstracts API complexity
- Quality report attachment is observable

**Test Coverage Strategy**:

```javascript
describe('PRAutomation', () => {
  describe('create()', () => {
    it('should create PR via gh CLI');
    it('should attach quality report');
    it('should set PR title from feature name');
    it('should set PR body with checklist');
    it('should notify maintainer');
  });

  describe('monitor()', () => {
    it('should poll PR status');
    it('should detect merge conflicts');
    it('should detect CI failures');
    it('should notify contributor of status changes');
  });
});
```

**Mock Strategy**:
- **GitHub CLI**: Mock `gh` command with custom script
- **GitHub API**: Use `nock` for API call interception
- **Notifications**: Mock email/webhook delivery

**Integration Test**:

```gherkin
Feature: Pull Request Automation
  Scenario: Create PR with quality report
    Given contributor workspace exists
    And quality gates pass with 87/100
    When contributor runs "aiwg -contribute-pr my-feature"
    Then PR is created on GitHub
    And quality report is attached as comment
    And maintainer is notified
    And CI/CD pipeline is triggered
```

**Gaps**:
- ⚠️ No specification for PR retry logic (what if `gh` fails?)
- ⚠️ No specification for rate limiting (GitHub API limits)
- ⚠️ Notification delivery failures not addressed

**Recommendation**: Define retry and rate limiting strategies.

### 3.3 End-to-End Contribution Workflow: 75/100

**Scenario Coverage** (from SAD Section 5.2): Good start but incomplete.

**Missing Test Scenarios**:

```gherkin
Scenario: Contributor submits below-threshold quality
  Given contributor workspace exists
  When quality gates run
  And score is 72/100 (below 80 threshold)
  Then PR creation is blocked
  And quality report highlights failing gates
  And contributor receives remediation guidance

Scenario: Maintainer rejects PR
  Given contributor PR exists
  When maintainer reviews and requests changes
  Then contributor is notified
  And contributor updates workspace
  And quality gates re-run automatically
  And updated PR is submitted

Scenario: Parallel contributions from same contributor
  Given contributor has workspace "feature-a"
  When contributor runs "aiwg -contribute-start feature-b"
  Then second workspace is created
  And workspaces are isolated
  And quality gates run independently
```

**Performance Testing**:

```javascript
describe('Contribution Workflow Performance', () => {
  it('should create workspace in <3s');
  it('should run quality gates in <30s');
  it('should create PR in <10s');
  it('should complete full workflow in <60s');
});
```

**Gaps**:
- ❌ **CRITICAL**: No test scenarios for contributor conflict resolution
- ❌ **CRITICAL**: No test scenarios for maintainer review cycle
- ⚠️ Performance targets for full workflow not specified in NFRs

**Recommendation**: Document complete workflow test suite with all scenarios.

---

## 4. Performance Test Considerations

### 4.1 Performance Target Validation: 70/100

**NFR Targets** (Section 3.2):
- NFR-01: Plugin installation <5s
- NFR-02: Quality gate execution <30s
- NFR-08: Platform abstraction overhead <10%

**Gaps**:
- ❌ **CRITICAL**: No baseline measurements - cannot validate "improvement" targets
- ❌ **CRITICAL**: No performance test harness specified
- ⚠️ Network-dependent operations (plugin download) make <5s unrealistic
- ⚠️ <30s quality gate target needs breakdown by gate type

**Recommended Performance Test Suite**:

```javascript
describe('Performance Benchmarks', () => {
  describe('Plugin Installation', () => {
    it('should install local plugin in <2s (no network)');
    it('should install remote plugin in <10s (with network)');
    it('should install 5 plugins sequentially in <30s');
    it('should install 5 plugins in parallel in <15s');
  });

  describe('Quality Gates', () => {
    it('should run markdown lint on 50 files in <5s');
    it('should run manifest sync in <2s');
    it('should run security scan in <10s');
    it('should run all gates in parallel in <15s');
  });

  describe('Traceability', () => {
    it('should build graph for 100 nodes in <5s');
    it('should validate graph in <3s');
    it('should run impact analysis in <2s');
  });
});
```

**Performance Test Infrastructure**:
- **Baseline Establishment**: Run performance tests on reference hardware before implementation
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Track performance in CI/CD on every commit
- **Regression Detection**: Fail build if performance degrades >20%
- **Profiling**: Use Node.js `--prof` flag to identify bottlenecks

**Gaps**:
- ❌ **CRITICAL**: No reference hardware specification for benchmark consistency
- ⚠️ No specification for performance regression tolerance
- ⚠️ No profiling strategy for bottleneck identification

**Recommendation**: Establish performance baselines in Elaboration phase before Construction begins.

### 4.2 Scalability Testing: 68/100

**NFR-04 Target**: Support 100+ contributors, 1000+ plugins

**Test Scenarios**:

```javascript
describe('Scalability', () => {
  describe('Plugin Registry', () => {
    it('should discover 1000 plugins in <30s');
    it('should search 1000 plugins in <1s');
    it('should cache 1000 plugin manifests in <100MB');
  });

  describe('Contributor Concurrency', () => {
    it('should handle 10 concurrent workspace creations');
    it('should handle 50 concurrent quality gate runs');
    it('should handle 100 concurrent PR submissions (staggered)');
  });

  describe('Traceability Graph', () => {
    it('should build graph for 10,000 nodes in <60s');
    it('should validate graph in <10s');
    it('should store graph in <50MB');
  });
});
```

**Load Testing Strategy**:
- **Synthetic Load**: Generate 100 dummy plugins for registry stress testing
- **Concurrency Testing**: Use `async.parallel()` to simulate concurrent operations
- **Memory Profiling**: Monitor memory usage under load with `heapdump`

**Gaps**:
- ❌ **CRITICAL**: No load testing infrastructure specified
- ⚠️ No specification for maximum concurrent operations
- ⚠️ No specification for resource limits (memory, disk, CPU)

**Recommendation**: Define load testing infrastructure and resource limits.

---

## 5. Test Strategy Gaps

### 5.1 Missing Test Coverage Areas

#### 5.1.1 Error Handling and Recovery

**Gaps**:
- **Network failures**: Plugin download timeout, connection reset, DNS failure
- **Filesystem errors**: Disk full, permission denied, file locked
- **Concurrency conflicts**: Race conditions, deadlocks, starvation
- **Data corruption**: Malformed JSON, truncated files, encoding issues
- **Resource exhaustion**: Memory limits, disk space, file handles

**Recommended Test Scenarios**:

```javascript
describe('Error Handling', () => {
  it('should retry plugin download on timeout (3 attempts)');
  it('should rollback on disk full error during installation');
  it('should detect and resolve workspace lock conflicts');
  it('should recover from malformed installed.json corruption');
  it('should handle OOM errors gracefully in graph building');
});
```

#### 5.1.2 Security Testing

**Gaps** (from Section 1.4):
- **Path traversal**: No tests specified
- **Symlink attacks**: No tests specified
- **Resource exhaustion**: No limits defined
- **Dependency vulnerabilities**: No scanning specified

**Recommended Security Test Suite**:

```javascript
describe('Security', () => {
  describe('Sandbox Isolation', () => {
    it('should block path traversal attempts');
    it('should prevent symlink following outside plugin dir');
    it('should enforce file size limits (100MB max)');
    it('should timeout infinite loops in hooks (30s max)');
  });

  describe('Dependency Security', () => {
    it('should scan plugin dependencies for CVEs');
    it('should block high-severity vulnerabilities');
    it('should warn on medium-severity vulnerabilities');
  });
});
```

#### 5.1.3 Multi-Platform Testing

**Gaps**:
- **Platform compatibility**: No tests for Claude vs OpenAI vs Cursor deployment differences
- **Adapter testing**: No tests for platform-specific adapters
- **Cross-platform validation**: No tests ensuring consistent behavior

**Recommended Multi-Platform Test Suite**:

```javascript
describe('Multi-Platform Support', () => {
  describe('Claude Deployment', () => {
    it('should deploy agents to .claude/agents/');
    it('should inject into CLAUDE.md');
  });

  describe('OpenAI Deployment', () => {
    it('should generate AGENTS.md file');
    it('should inject into project README');
  });

  describe('Cursor Deployment', () => {
    it('should deploy agents to .cursor/agents/');
    it('should update .cursor/config.json');
  });

  describe('Cross-Platform Validation', () => {
    it('should produce equivalent agent definitions across platforms');
    it('should maintain feature parity');
  });
});
```

#### 5.1.4 Backward Compatibility Testing

**Gaps** (NFR-04: 100% backward compatibility):
- **Version compatibility**: No tests for plugin version migrations
- **API compatibility**: No tests for breaking changes detection
- **Data migration**: No tests for upgrading plugins

**Recommended Compatibility Test Suite**:

```javascript
describe('Backward Compatibility', () => {
  it('should load plugins created with v1.0.0 manifest');
  it('should migrate v1.0 manifest to v2.0 schema');
  it('should detect breaking changes in plugin updates');
  it('should maintain installed.json compatibility across AIWG versions');
});
```

### 5.2 Test Data Management Strategy: MISSING

**Critical Gap**: No specification for test data organization.

**Recommended Test Data Catalog**:

**Recommendation**: Create test data catalog before integration testing begins.

### 5.3 Test Execution Strategy: INCOMPLETE

**Gaps**:
- **No specification for test execution order** (unit → integration → E2E?)
- **No specification for parallel test execution** (can tests run concurrently?)
- **No specification for test environment setup** (local, CI/CD, staging?)

**Recommended Test Execution Strategy**:

```yaml
# test-execution-plan.yaml
phases:
  unit:
    parallel: true
    timeout: 300s
    includes:
      - test/unit/**/*.test.js

  integration:
    parallel: false  # Sequential for resource isolation
    timeout: 600s
    setup: scripts/setup-integration-env.sh
    teardown: scripts/cleanup-integration-env.sh
    includes:
      - test/integration/**/*.test.js

  e2e:
    parallel: false
    timeout: 1200s
    setup: scripts/setup-e2e-env.sh
    includes:
      - test/e2e/**/*.test.js

  performance:
    parallel: false
    requires: baseline-data.json
    includes:
      - test/performance/**/*.bench.js
```

**Recommendation**: Document test execution strategy in master test plan.

## 7. ADR Feedback

### ADR-005: Quality Gate Thresholds (80/100 minimum)

**Testability Assessment**: STRONG (95/100)

**Strengths**:
- Clear threshold (80/100) is measurable and automatable
- Weighted scoring model (Appendix C) is deterministic
- Objective criteria dominate (markdown, manifest, security)

**Concerns**:
- **Threshold tuning**: 80/100 is reasonable but unvalidated. May need adjustment after real contributor data.
- **Edge cases**: What if a gate crashes? Does it score 0 or is it excluded from weighting?
- **Gaming**: Contributors might optimize for score over quality. Need manual review for subjective aspects.

**Test Recommendations**:
1. **Validate threshold with historical data**: Apply 80/100 threshold to existing AIWG PRs. What % would pass?
2. **Sensitivity analysis**: Test threshold at 70, 75, 80, 85, 90. Find optimal balance.
3. **False positive/negative rates**: Measure how often quality gates produce wrong results.

**Suggested Enhancement to ADR-005**:

> **Testing Strategy**: Quality gate thresholds will be validated against historical PR data during Elaboration phase. Initial threshold of 80/100 will be adjusted based on empirical false positive/negative rates. Target: <5% false positives (good contributions rejected), <10% false negatives (poor contributions accepted).

- **Given**: New contributor discovers AIWG
- **When**: Contributor attempts first plugin submission
- **Then**: Clear guidance at each step, achieves 80/100 on first attempt

**Scenario 2**: Experienced contributor, multiple simultaneous features
- **Given**: Contributor has 3 active feature branches
- **When**: Contributor switches between workspaces
- **Then**: Workspace isolation prevents cross-contamination

**Scenario 3**: Contributor receives critical feedback
- **Given**: Maintainer requests major changes to submitted plugin
- **When**: Contributor updates workspace and resubmits
- **Then**: Quality gates re-run, PR is updated, maintainer is notified

### 8.2 Maintainer Workflow Test Scenarios

**Scenario 4**: Maintainer reviews high-quality PR
- **Given**: PR with 92/100 quality score
- **When**: Maintainer reviews automated quality report
- **Then**: Minimal manual review required, merge in <10 minutes

**Scenario 5**: Maintainer reviews borderline PR
- **Given**: PR with 81/100 quality score (just above threshold)
- **When**: Maintainer reviews automated quality report
- **Then**: Detailed manual review required, merge/reject decision takes 30+ minutes

**Scenario 6**: Maintainer rejects malicious plugin
- **Given**: Plugin attempts path traversal in post_install hook
- **When**: Security gate detects malicious behavior
- **Then**: PR is automatically blocked, contributor is warned

### 8.3 System Resilience Test Scenarios

**Scenario 7**: GitHub API rate limit reached
- **Given**: 100 contributors attempt plugin discovery simultaneously
- **When**: GitHub API rate limit is hit

**Scenario 8**: Disk space exhausted during plugin installation
- **Given**: User has <100MB free disk space
- **When**: Plugin installation requires 150MB
- **Then**: Pre-flight check fails, clear error message, no partial installation

**Scenario 9**: Concurrent plugin installations conflict
- **Given**: User runs `aiwg -install-plugin A` and `aiwg -install-plugin B` simultaneously
- **When**: Both attempt to update `installed.json`
- **Then**: Lock mechanism prevents corruption, second install queues

**Scenario 10**: Traceability graph becomes too large
- **Given**: Project has 10,000+ requirements
- **When**: Traceability validation runs
- **Then**: Graph is sampled/partitioned, validation completes in <120s
