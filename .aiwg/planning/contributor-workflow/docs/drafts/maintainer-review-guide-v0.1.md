## Quality Gates and Standards

### Automated Quality Gates

The `aiwg -review-pr` command runs these validation checks:

#### 1. Markdown Lint (Required)

**Validation:** All markdown files pass markdownlint-cli2 rules

**Common Issues:**
- MD012: Multiple blank lines
- MD022/MD032: Heading/list spacing
- MD031/MD040: Code fence issues
- MD041: First line should be H1
- MD047: Files end with newline

**Fix Commands (for contributors):**
```bash
# Run all fixers
node tools/lint/fix-md12.mjs --target . --write
node tools/lint/fix-md-heading-lists.mjs --target . --write
node tools/lint/fix-md-codefences.mjs --target . --write
node tools/lint/fix-md41-firsth1.mjs --target . --write
node tools/lint/fix-md47-finalnewline.mjs --target . --write
```

**Score Impact:** -5 points per unfixed error

#### 2. Manifest Sync (Required)

**Validation:** All directory manifests are up-to-date

**Common Issues:**
- New files added without manifest update
- File descriptions missing or generic
- Metadata incomplete

**Fix Commands:**
```bash
# Regenerate manifests
node tools/manifest/generate-manifest.mjs <dir> --write-md
node tools/manifest/enrich-manifests.mjs --target . --write
node tools/manifest/sync-manifests.mjs --target . --fix --write-md
```

**Score Impact:** -10 points if out of sync

#### 3. Documentation Completeness (Required)

**Validation:** All required documentation is present and complete

**Required Documentation:**
- [ ] **README.md updated** - Feature mentioned in relevant section
- [ ] **Quick-start guide exists** - `docs/<category>/<feature>-quickstart.md`
- [ ] **Integration doc complete** - Detailed usage, examples, troubleshooting

**Optional Documentation (adds points):**
- [ ] **Video tutorial** or animated GIF
- [ ] **Migration guide** (for breaking changes)
- [ ] **API reference** (if adding programmatic interface)

**Score Impact:** -20 points per missing required doc, +5 points per optional doc

#### 4. Breaking Change Analysis (Required)

**Validation:** Breaking changes are identified and documented

**What Constitutes Breaking Change:**
- CLI command signature changes (flags, arguments)
- File path changes (templates, agents, commands)
- Configuration schema changes
- Removal of features or commands
- Behavior changes to existing features

**Required for Breaking Changes:**
- [ ] **BREAKING CHANGE** noted in commit message
- [ ] **Migration guide** provided in docs
- [ ] **Deprecation notices** added (if applicable)
- [ ] **Version bump** planned (major version)

**Score Impact:** -30 points if breaking change not documented

#### 5. Security Scan (Basic)

**Validation:** No obvious security issues

**Checks:**
- No hardcoded credentials or tokens
- No obvious command injection vulnerabilities
- No path traversal issues
- No eval() or dangerous code execution

**Score Impact:** -50 points if security issue found (likely reject)

### Quality Score Calculation

**Base Score:** 100 points

**Deductions:**
- Markdown lint errors: -5 per error
- Manifest out of sync: -10
- Missing required doc: -20 per doc
- Breaking change undocumented: -30
- Security issue: -50

**Bonuses:**
- Optional docs: +5 per doc
- Comprehensive tests: +10
- Video tutorial: +10

**Thresholds:**
- **90-100:** Excellent - Immediate approval candidate
- **80-89:** Good - Minor improvements needed
- **70-79:** Acceptable - Changes requested
- **Below 70:** Needs significant work - Reject or major rework

## Requesting Changes

### Best Practices for Feedback

#### Be Specific and Actionable

**Bad Example:**
```markdown
The documentation needs improvement.
```

**Good Example:**
```markdown
Documentation: Add --mode flag usage to quickstart

File: docs/integrations/cursor-quickstart.md
Location: Lines 25-30

Current: Only shows basic deployment
```bash
aiwg -deploy-agents --platform cursor
```

Add: Show mode selection
```bash
# Deploy SDLC agents only
aiwg -deploy-agents --platform cursor --mode sdlc

# Deploy general-purpose agents only
aiwg -deploy-agents --platform cursor --mode general

# Deploy both (default)
aiwg -deploy-agents --platform cursor --mode both
```

Why: Users need to understand mode selection to choose the right agent set.
```

#### Provide Context and Examples

**Bad Example:**
```markdown
Follow existing patterns.
```

**Good Example:**
```markdown
CLI Routing: Follow existing platform pattern

File: tools/install/install.sh
Location: After line 245

Reference: See --platform warp implementation (lines 234-242)

Add this case to the --platform switch:
```bash
cursor)
    node "$INSTALL_DIR/tools/cursor/setup-cursor.mjs" "${@:2}"
    exit 0
    ;;
```

Why: Ensures consistent CLI behavior across all platform integrations.
```

#### Balance Criticism with Encouragement

**Bad Example:**
```markdown
This code is poorly structured and doesn't follow our conventions.
```

**Good Example:**
```markdown
Code Structure: Great start! Let's align with AIWG conventions

File: tools/cursor/setup-cursor.mjs
Location: Lines 45-60

Current approach works, but let's use our existing error handling pattern:

Current:
```javascript
if (!fs.existsSync(cursorDir)) {
  console.error("Cursor directory not found");
  process.exit(1);
}
```

Suggested:
```javascript
const { validateDirectory } = require('../lib/validation.mjs');

try {
  validateDirectory(cursorDir, 'Cursor configuration');
} catch (error) {
  console.error(`Error: ${error.message}`);
  process.exit(1);
}
```

Why: Reuses existing validation logic and provides consistent error messages.

The core logic is solid - this is just about consistency with the rest of the codebase!
```

### Feedback Structure Template

Use this structure for all change requests:

```markdown
## Summary
{1-2 sentences summarizing overall feedback}

## Approving and Merging

### Pre-Approval Checklist

Before approving any PR, verify:

- [ ] **All quality gates passed** (run `aiwg -review-pr` final time)
- [ ] **Code review complete** (all files reviewed manually)
- [ ] **Documentation accurate** (quick-start tested, examples work)
- [ ] **No security concerns** (no hardcoded secrets, safe code execution)
- [ ] **Breaking changes handled** (documented, migration guide present)
- [ ] **CI passing** (all GitHub Actions green)

### Approval Process

#### Step 1: Final Validation

```bash
# Run final review
aiwg -review-pr 123

# Verify quality score >= 90 (or 80 with good justification)
# Verify all gates passed
# Verify CI is passing
```

#### Step 2: Approve with Comment

```bash
# Approve with auto-merge
aiwg -review-approve 123 --auto-merge --comment "Great contribution! {specific praise}"

# Or approve without auto-merge (if you want manual control)
aiwg -review-approve 123 --comment "Approved! Will merge after {condition}"
```

**Approval Comment Template:**
```markdown
Excellent work on this contribution!

Quality Score: {score}/100
✓ All quality gates passed
✓ Code quality: {High/Excellent}
✓ Documentation: {Complete/Thorough}
✓ Testing: {Strategy provided/Manual testing complete}

{Specific thing you appreciated about this PR}

Approved with auto-merge enabled. Thank you for improving AIWG!
```

#### Step 3: Merge Strategy

**Auto-Merge (Default):**
- Enable with `--auto-merge` flag
- Merges automatically when CI passes
- Best for straightforward contributions
- Reduces maintainer overhead

**Manual Merge:**
- Use when coordination needed (with other PRs, release timing, etc.)
- Use when final validation needed before merge
- Use for breaking changes (coordinate version bump)

**Merge Method:**
- **Squash and merge** (default): For most contributions - clean history
- **Rebase and merge**: For well-structured commit history
- **Merge commit**: For large multi-feature contributions (rare)

#### Step 4: Post-Merge Actions

**Immediately After Merge:**
```bash
# Thank contributor (if not auto-generated)
gh pr comment 123 --body "Merged! Thanks for your contribution to AIWG!"

# Check if release needed
# - Platform integration: Increment minor version
# - Bug fix: Increment patch version
# - Breaking change: Increment major version
```

**Update Documentation:**
- Add to CHANGELOG.md (if applicable)
- Update version in package.json (if applicable)
- Add contributor to CONTRIBUTORS.md (if exists)

**Milestone and Project Management:**
- Close related issues (if any)
- Update project board (if using GitHub Projects)
- Assign milestone (if applicable)

### Release Coordination

**Patch Releases (Bug Fixes, Docs):**
- Can be released immediately after merge
- No version coordination needed
- Update via `aiwg -update`

**Minor Releases (Features, Platform Integrations):**
- Batch similar PRs if possible (e.g., multiple platform integrations)
- Announce in release notes
- Coordinate timing (avoid weekends, holidays)

**Major Releases (Breaking Changes):**
- Requires team discussion
- Plan migration path
- Announce well in advance
- Provide migration guide
- Update all documentation

1. `--deploy-agents` now requires `--platform` flag (previously optional)
2. Default behavior changed from "all platforms" to "current platform only"

**Impact:**
- Existing scripts using `aiwg --deploy-agents` will fail
- Users must specify `--platform all` for old behavior

**Migration:**
✓ Migration guide provided: docs/migrations/v1-to-v2.md
✓ Error message guides users to fix
✓ Documentation updated

**Approval Status:**
- @maintainer1: Approved
- @maintainer2: Awaiting review

**Release Plan:**
- Version: 2.0.0 (major bump)
- Timeline: Merge after all approvals, release in 2 weeks
- Announcement: Blog post + GitHub release notes

Tagging team for review: @maintainer1 @maintainer2
```

### Security Concerns

**Red Flags:**
- Hardcoded credentials, tokens, or secrets
- Command injection vulnerabilities (e.g., unsanitized `exec()`)
- Path traversal risks (e.g., `../../../etc/passwd`)
- Arbitrary code execution (e.g., `eval()`, `Function()`)
- Unsafe file operations (e.g., no validation before write)

**Review Process:**
1. **Immediate Action:**
   ```bash
   # Do NOT approve
   # Request immediate changes or close PR

   gh pr comment 123 --body "SECURITY ISSUE: {description} - Please fix immediately"
   ```

2. **Private Discussion:**
   - For sensitive vulnerabilities, discuss privately (not in PR comments)
   - Use GitHub Security Advisory if needed

3. **Example Comment (for minor issues):**
   ```markdown
   ## Security Issue

   **File:** tools/contrib/create-pr.mjs
   **Line:** 45

   **Issue:** User input directly interpolated into shell command

   **Current:**
   ```javascript
   exec(`gh pr create --title "${title}"`)
   ```

   **Risk:** Title with special characters could execute arbitrary commands

   **Fix:**
   ```javascript
   const { execFile } = require('child_process');
   execFile('gh', ['pr', 'create', '--title', title])
   ```

   **Why:** `execFile` doesn't spawn shell, preventing injection attacks.

   Please fix before approval. Security is our top priority!
   ```

4. **Approval Only After:**
   - [ ] Security issue fixed
   - [ ] Fix verified by maintainer
   - [ ] No other security concerns found

### Large Refactors

**Definition:**
- Changes >500 lines across multiple files
- Architectural changes affecting multiple components
- Significant behavior changes to core features

**Review Process:**
1. **Early Discussion:**
   - Ideally, large refactors should be discussed BEFORE PR submission
   - Use GitHub Discussions or Issues to align on approach

2. **Phased Review:**
   ```bash
   # Review in chunks
   gh pr files 123 | head -10  # Review first 10 files

   # Request contributor to explain changes
   gh pr comment 123 --body "Can you provide a high-level overview of the refactor strategy?"
   ```

3. **Test Thoroughly:**
   - Require comprehensive testing strategy
   - Manual testing by multiple maintainers
   - Check all integration points

4. **Example Comment:**
   ```markdown
   ## Large Refactor Review

   This is a significant change. Let's ensure quality:

   **Scope:**
   - 847 lines changed across 23 files
   - Refactors CLI routing architecture
   - Affects all platform integrations

   **Review Strategy:**
   1. High-level architecture review (me)
   2. Platform integration testing (@maintainer1)
   3. Backward compatibility testing (@maintainer2)

   **Questions:**
   1. Can you provide a migration guide for this refactor?
   2. Have you tested all existing platform integrations?
   3. Are there any breaking changes we should be aware of?

   Timeline: This will take 3-5 days to review thoroughly. Thanks for your patience!
   ```

### Multi-Platform Impacts

**Scenario:** PR affects multiple platforms (Claude, Warp, Cursor, etc.)

**Review Process:**
1. **Test on All Platforms:**
   ```bash
   # Deploy to each platform and test
   aiwg -deploy-agents --platform claude --mode both
   aiwg -deploy-agents --platform warp --mode both
   aiwg -deploy-agents --platform cursor --mode both

   # Verify functionality on each
   ```

2. **Check Platform-Specific Files:**
   - `.claude/agents/`
   - `.warp/workflows/`
   - `.cursor/rules`

3. **Example Comment:**
   ```markdown
   ## Multi-Platform Impact Check

   This PR affects all platform integrations. Testing:

   **Platforms Tested:**
   - ✓ Claude: Agents deployed and functional
   - ✓ Warp: Workflows generated correctly
   - ⏳ Cursor: Testing in progress
   - ❌ Windsurf: Error in rule generation (details below)

   **Issue Found (Windsurf):**
   File: tools/windsurf/setup-windsurf.mjs:67
   Error: `undefined is not a function` when generating rules

   Please fix Windsurf compatibility before merge.
   ```

### Example 2: Good PR - Minor Changes Needed

**Scenario:** Windsurf platform integration, quality score 82/100

```markdown
## Review Summary

PR #125: Add Windsurf editor platform integration
Quality Score: 82/100

### Automated Quality Gates
✓ Markdown lint: PASSED
✓ Manifest sync: PASSED
⚠ Documentation: INCOMPLETE (missing troubleshooting section)
✓ Breaking changes: NONE
✓ Security scan: PASSED

### Manual Review
✓ Code quality: Good - minor consistency improvements needed
⚠ Architecture: Fits well, but error handling could be more robust
✓ UX: Clear output, but error messages need improvement
✓ Testing: Basic manual steps provided

### Required Changes

#### 1. Documentation: Add troubleshooting section
**File:** docs/integrations/windsurf-quickstart.md
**Location:** End of file (after examples)
**Issue:** Users will encounter common issues - need guidance

**Add:**
```markdown
## Troubleshooting

### Error: "Windsurf configuration directory not found"
**Cause:** Windsurf not installed or using non-standard location
**Fix:**
1. Verify Windsurf is installed: `which windsurf`
2. Check config location: `ls ~/.config/windsurf`
3. Specify custom location: `aiwg -deploy-agents --platform windsurf --config-dir /custom/path`

### Error: "Permission denied writing to .windsurf/rules"
**Cause:** File permissions issue
**Fix:**
```bash
chmod 755 ~/.windsurf
chmod 644 ~/.windsurf/rules
```

### Agents not loading in Windsurf
**Cause:** Windsurf needs restart after rule changes
**Fix:** Close and reopen Windsurf
```

**Why:** Every integration doc has troubleshooting - helps users self-service

#### 2. Error Handling: Improve validation messages
**File:** tools/windsurf/setup-windsurf.mjs
**Location:** Lines 45-60
**Issue:** Generic error messages don't guide users to solutions

**Current:**
```javascript
if (!fs.existsSync(configDir)) {
  console.error("Configuration directory not found");
  process.exit(1);
}
```

**Suggested:**
```javascript
if (!fs.existsSync(configDir)) {
  console.error(`Error: Windsurf configuration directory not found at ${configDir}`);
  console.error(`\nPossible solutions:`);
  console.error(`1. Install Windsurf editor from https://windsurf.ai`);
  console.error(`2. Verify installation: which windsurf`);
  console.error(`3. Use custom location: --config-dir /path/to/config`);
  process.exit(1);
}
```

**Why:** Actionable error messages reduce support burden

### What You Got Right
- **Platform Detection:** Excellent auto-detection of Windsurf installation
- **Code Structure:** Clean separation of concerns
- **Integration:** Smooth CLI integration with --platform flag

### Next Steps
1. Add troubleshooting section to quickstart (15 min)
2. Improve error messages (10 min)
3. Reply here when ready for re-review

Expected turnaround: 24-48 hours. If you have questions or need help, just ask!

### Example 3: Needs Significant Work

**Scenario:** Custom SDLC workflow contribution, quality score 73/100

```markdown
## Review Summary

PR #127: Add custom workflow for microservices architecture
Quality Score: 73/100

### Automated Quality Gates
⚠ Markdown lint: FAILED (12 errors)
✓ Manifest sync: PASSED
⚠ Documentation: INCOMPLETE (missing quick-start, integration doc)
✓ Breaking changes: NONE
✓ Security scan: PASSED

### Manual Review
⚠ Code quality: Inconsistent with AIWG patterns
⚠ Architecture: Doesn't leverage existing flow infrastructure
⚠ UX: Output formatting inconsistent with other commands
✓ Testing: Manual steps provided but incomplete

### Required Changes

Thank you for this contribution! The idea of microservices-specific workflows is valuable. However, several areas need improvement before we can merge:

#### 1. Markdown Linting
**Issue:** 12 markdown lint errors across documentation files

**Fix:**
Run our lint fixers:
```bash
node tools/lint/fix-md12.mjs --target . --write
node tools/lint/fix-md-heading-lists.mjs --target . --write
node tools/lint/fix-md47-finalnewline.mjs --target . --write
```

Then verify:
```bash
npm exec markdownlint-cli2 "docs/**/*.md"
```

#### 2. Documentation Structure
**Issue:** Missing required documentation

**Required:**
1. **Quick-start guide:** `docs/workflows/microservices-quickstart.md`
   - 5-minute getting started
   - Basic example
   - Common use cases

2. **Integration guide:** `docs/workflows/microservices-workflow.md`
   - Detailed usage
   - Configuration options
   - Advanced examples
   - Troubleshooting

**Template:** See `docs/integrations/cursor-quickstart.md` as reference

#### 3. Architecture Alignment
**File:** tools/workflows/microservices-workflow.mjs
**Issue:** Reimplements flow orchestration instead of using existing infrastructure

**Current Approach:** Custom orchestration logic (lines 45-150)

**Suggested Approach:** Leverage existing flow commands

Instead of custom orchestration, create a flow command that uses existing SDLC flows:

**Example:**
```javascript
// tools/workflows/microservices-workflow.mjs
import { executeFlow } from '../lib/flow-executor.mjs';

export async function microservicesWorkflow(options) {
  // Use existing flows with microservices-specific configuration
  await executeFlow('flow-architecture-evolution', {
    archType: 'microservices',
    components: options.services,
    ...options
  });

  await executeFlow('flow-test-strategy-execution', {
    testType: 'integration',
    scope: 'cross-service',
    ...options
  });
}
```

**Why:** Reuses battle-tested orchestration logic, maintains consistency

**Reference:** See `tools/lib/flow-executor.mjs` for existing patterns

#### 4. Output Formatting
**File:** tools/workflows/microservices-workflow.mjs
**Lines:** 200-250
**Issue:** Inconsistent output formatting

**Follow AIWG patterns:**
```javascript
// Use our logging utilities
import { logSuccess, logWarning, logError, logInfo } from '../lib/logger.mjs';

// Consistent status symbols
logSuccess('✓ Service architecture validated');
logWarning('⚠ Service B has circular dependency');
logError('❌ Service C failed health check');
logInfo('⏳ Running integration tests...');
```

**Reference:** See `tools/lib/logger.mjs`

### What You Got Right
- **Valuable Use Case:** Microservices workflows are a real need
- **Good Examples:** Real-world service configurations
- **Testing Mindset:** Included test strategy

### Suggestions for Success
1. **Start with Documentation:** Write the quick-start first (helps clarify the UX)
2. **Reuse Infrastructure:** Don't reinvent - extend existing flows
3. **Follow Patterns:** Study similar contributions (platform integrations, other workflows)
4. **Ask Questions:** Unsure about architecture? Let's discuss before more coding

### Next Steps
1. Fix markdown linting (quick win - 5 min)
2. Add required documentation (1-2 hours)
3. Refactor to use existing flow infrastructure (2-3 hours)
4. Update output formatting (30 min)

**Estimated Effort:** 4-6 hours total

If you'd like to discuss approach before reworking, I'm happy to hop on a call or provide more detailed guidance. This is a valuable contribution worth getting right!

## Contribution Metrics

### Tracking Community Health

Use `aiwg -review-stats` to monitor:

#### Response Time Metrics

**Target:** First review within 24 hours

**Measurement:**
```bash
aiwg -review-stats --since "30 days ago" | grep "Median time to first review"
```

**Red Flags:**
- Median >48 hours: Maintainers overloaded
- High variance: Inconsistent attention
- Old PRs accumulating: Need triage

**Action Items:**
- If >48h: Recruit additional reviewers
- If inconsistent: Set reviewer rotation schedule
- If accumulating: Dedicated triage session

#### Merge Rate Metrics

**Target:** >80% merge rate (of quality contributions)

**Measurement:**
```bash
aiwg -review-stats | grep "Merged:"
# Merged: 12 (80%)
```

**Analysis:**
- <70%: Too strict or poor contributor guidance
- 90-100%: Healthy acceptance rate
- 100%: Possibly too lenient

**Action Items:**
- If low: Review rejection reasons, improve contributor docs
- If high: Ensure quality gates are working

#### Quality Score Trends

**Target:** Average quality score trending upward

**Measurement:**
```bash
aiwg -review-stats --since "90 days ago"
# Compare to:
aiwg -review-stats --since "30 days ago"
```

**Positive Trends:**
- Score increasing over time
- Fewer low-score PRs
- More first-time contributors with high scores

**Indicates:**
- Contributor docs are working
- `aiwg -contribute-*` commands helping quality
- Community learning and improving

#### Contributor Growth

**Target:** +10 new contributors per month

**Measurement:**
```bash
aiwg -review-stats --since "30 days ago" | grep "Top Contributors"
# Count new names vs. previous month
```

**Healthy Indicators:**
- New contributors each month
- Repeat contributors returning
- Diverse contribution types (not just one person doing platform integrations)

**Action Items:**
- Recognize top contributors publicly
- Welcome first-time contributors warmly
- Highlight contribution opportunities

### Monthly Health Check

**Run This Monthly:**
```bash
# Generate comprehensive stats
aiwg -review-stats --since "30 days ago" > /tmp/monthly-stats.txt

# Review:
cat /tmp/monthly-stats.txt

# Check for:
# 1. Response time under 24h median
# 2. Merge rate >80%
# 3. No PRs >7 days old
# 4. Quality scores trending up
# 5. New contributors present
```

**Share with Team:**
- Post in maintainer channel
- Discuss any red flags
- Celebrate wins (new contributors, high quality PRs)
- Plan improvements (docs, automation, etc.)

## Best Practices

### Consistency is Key

**Use Templates:** Every review should follow similar structure
**Use Commands:** Prefer `aiwg -review-*` over manual `gh` commands (ensures consistency)
**Document Decisions:** If you deviate from guidelines, explain why in PR comments

### Communication Standards

**Response Time:**
- First review: Within 24 hours
- Re-review after changes: Within 24 hours
- Questions: Within 12 hours

**Tone:**
- Professional but friendly
- Constructive, not critical
- Encouraging, especially for first-time contributors

**Specificity:**
- Always provide file/line references
- Always provide examples or suggestions
- Never say "fix this" without saying "how"

### Review Efficiency

**Parallel Review:**
- Don't review line-by-line sequentially
- Skim entire PR first (get big picture)
- Then dive into details
- Batch similar feedback together

**Use Automation:**
- Let quality gates catch mechanical issues
- Focus manual review on architecture, UX, and logic
- Trust CI to catch test failures

**Time-Box Reviews:**
- Simple PRs: 15-30 minutes
- Medium PRs: 30-60 minutes
- Complex PRs: 1-2 hours (or split across multiple sessions)

### Building Community

**Recognize Contributions:**
```markdown
# In approval comments
Thank you @contributor for this excellent work! Your attention to detail in the documentation is especially appreciated.

# In monthly updates
Shout out to @contributor1, @contributor2, @contributor3 for their platform integration contributions this month!
```

**Invest in First-Time Contributors:**
- Extra patience and explanation
- Offer to pair program or hop on call
- Follow up after merge ("How was the experience?")

**Create Contribution Opportunities:**
- Label issues as "good first contribution"
- Document "most wanted" integrations or features
- Share contribution ideas in discussions

### Maintain Quality Standards

**Never Compromise On:**
- Security (reject if any security concerns)
- Documentation (no merges without docs)
- Breaking changes (must be documented and discussed)

**Be Flexible On:**
- Code style minutiae (if functional and maintainable)
- Perfect scores (80+ is often good enough)
- Process (contributor didn't use `aiwg -contribute-*`? That's okay)

**Balance:**
- Quality vs. velocity
- Strictness vs. community growth
- Perfection vs. good enough

### Continuous Improvement

**Track Patterns:**
- Common issues across PRs? → Update contributor docs
- Repeated questions? → Add to FAQ
- Quality gate missed something? → Improve automation

**Retrospectives:**
- Monthly: Review stats, discuss what's working
- Quarterly: Bigger picture - process improvements
- Annually: Major changes - quality standards, automation, etc.

**Iterate on Process:**
- This guide isn't static
- Update based on learnings
- Share improvements with team
