# Technical Writing Review: AIWG Maintainer Review Guide

**Reviewer:** Technical Writer
**Date:** 2025-10-17
**Document Version:** 0.1 (Draft)
**Review Status:** CONDITIONAL

## Summary

This maintainer review guide is comprehensive and well-structured with excellent practical examples. The document demonstrates strong technical knowledge and provides actionable guidance. However, it requires clarity improvements in several areas: terminology consistency, reduced jargon density, and streamlined decision-making sections. The tone is professional and appropriate for the maintainer audience.

**Overall Quality:** 82/100

## Issues Found

### Critical (Must Fix)

1. **Terminology Inconsistency** - Location: Throughout document
   - Uses "quality gate" and "quality gates" interchangeably (sometimes as proper noun, sometimes not)
   - Switches between "PR" and "pull request" without establishing preference
   - Inconsistent capitalization: "Quality Score" vs "quality score"
   - **Fix:** Standardize on "quality gate" (lowercase), "PR" after first use defines it, "quality score" (lowercase except when labeling specific output)

2. **Missing Acronym Definitions** - Location: First usage
   - "AIWG" not defined until Prerequisites section (should be in opening)
   - "SDLC" used on line 64 without definition
   - "CLI" used on line 62 without definition
   - **Fix:** Add definitions on first use in Prerequisites or earlier

### Major (Should Fix)

1. **Clarity: Dense Jargon in Quality Gates Section** - Location: Lines 108-223
   - Section introduces 5 complex validation concepts rapidly without transition
   - Score calculation formula buried in middle (line 202) - should be prominent
   - **Suggestion:** Add overview paragraph before diving into gates. Move score calculation to callout box.

2. **Structure: Decision Tree Too Complex** - Location: Lines 536-680
   - Mermaid diagram shows 15 decision points - difficult to parse
   - Immediately followed by text-based decision framework with overlapping information
   - **Suggestion:** Simplify to 4 primary outcomes (Approve, Minor Changes, Major Changes, Reject) with flowchart. Move detailed criteria to subsections.

3. **Passive Voice Overuse in Command Reference** - Location: Lines 250-535
   - "Quality gates are run" â†’ "Runs quality gates"
   - "Review is posted" â†’ "Posts review"
   - "Notification is sent" â†’ "Sends notification"
   - **Fix:** Convert to active voice for clarity

4. **Heading Hierarchy Skip** - Location: Line 681
   - "Special Case Decision Matrix" is H3, but should be H2 (it's a major section, not subsection of Decision Framework)
   - **Fix:** Promote to H2 and adjust subsequent headings

### Minor (Nice to Fix)

1. **Vague Quantifiers** - Location: Multiple
   - Line 98: "24-48 hours" could specify business days vs calendar days
   - Line 1519: "4-6 hours total" - is this developer-hours or calendar time?
   - **Suggestion:** Clarify time units

2. **Example Code Inconsistency** - Location: Lines 700-800
   - Some examples use markdown code fences, others use inline code
   - Bash examples sometimes have `$` prompt, sometimes don't
   - **Suggestion:** Standardize on fenced blocks with language tag, no `$` prompt

3. **Redundant Phrasing** - Location: Multiple
   - "Thanks for your patience!" appears 3 times
   - "Let's ensure quality:" appears twice
   - **Suggestion:** Vary language to avoid repetition

## Clarity Improvements

### Made Directly (Minor Fixes)

- **Line 8:** "Table of Contents" â†’ Clear (no change needed)
- **Recommend:** Change "Quality Gates and Standards" (heading) to "Automated Quality Validation" for clarity on what "gate" means

### Suggested for Author

1. **Quality Score Section Reorganization:**
   - Move score calculation (lines 202-223) to top of "Quality Score Calculation" subsection
   - Add visual example: "Example: PR with 2 markdown errors (-10), missing doc (-20), excellent tests (+10) = 80/100"

2. **Simplify Decision Tree:**

   **Current:** 15-node flowchart with complex branching
   **Suggested:** 4-outcome decision tree:

   ```text
   Quality Score â†’ Action
   90-100       â†’ Approve (auto-merge)
   80-89        â†’ Approve or request minor changes
   70-79        â†’ Request changes
   <70          â†’ Reject or major rework
   ```

3. **Command Reference Clarity:**
   - Add "What happens" before/after each command
   - Example: "Before running: Ensure PR branch is checked out locally"
   - Example: "After running: GitHub sends email notification to contributor"

## Consistency Fixes

### Terminology Standardization

**Standardize on:**

- "PR" (after defining "pull request (PR)" on first use)
- "quality gate" (lowercase, not proper noun)
- "quality score" (lowercase except in output labels)
- "AIWG" (defined as "AI Writing Guide (AIWG)" on first use in Prerequisites)

**Current inconsistencies:**

- Line 112: "Quality Gates" (capitalized heading - okay)
- Line 269: "quality gates" (lowercase in running text - okay)
- Line 241: "Quality Score: 85/100" (capitalized in output label - okay)
- Line 303: "quality score trending upward" (lowercase in running text - okay)

**Recommendation:** Document is mostly consistent. Just clarify in style note that capitalization is contextual (headings/labels vs running text).

### Formatting Standardization

**Code Blocks:**

- **Good:** Lines 27-33 (language tags present, no `$` prompt)
- **Inconsistent:** Lines 747-753 (has `$` prompt in some places, not others)
- **Fix:** Remove all `$` prompts from code examples (not needed, adds visual clutter)

**Lists:**

- **Good:** Lines 228-248 (parallel structure - all start with noun)
- **Inconsistent:** Lines 866-873 (mix of checkbox items - some are questions, some are statements)
- **Fix:** Make all checklist items statements (not questions)

### Cross-Reference Accuracy

**Verified:**

- âœ“ Section links in TOC match actual headings
- âœ“ File path references are plausible (cannot verify actual existence without context)
- âœ“ Line number references in examples are illustrative (not literal file references)

**Potential issue:**

- Line 69: References `/home/manitcor/dev/ai-writing-guide/...` - uses absolute path with username. Should this be relative or generic?
- **Recommendation:** Change to relative paths from repo root (e.g., `agentic/code/frameworks/sdlc-complete/README.md`)

## Tone and Style Feedback

### Tone Assessment: Professional and Encouraging

**Strengths:**

- Balances authority with approachability
- Uses "you" to address maintainers directly (conversational but professional)
- Encourages community-building ("Invest in First-Time Contributors")
- Acknowledges complexity without being dismissive ("This is normal!")

**Examples of excellent tone:**

- Line 1201: "Don't worry - this is normal!" (reassuring)
- Line 1270: "Welcome to the AIWG contributors list ðŸŽ‰" (celebratory)
- Line 1521: "This is a valuable contribution worth getting right!" (encouraging despite requesting changes)

### Style Issues

1. **Sentence Length Variation Needed:**
   - Lines 1470-1490 (Example 3) has 6 consecutive short sentences
   - **Suggestion:** Combine some for better rhythm: "The idea of microservices-specific workflows is valuable, but several areas need improvement before we can merge."

2. **Emoji Usage:**
   - Emoji used sparingly and appropriately (ðŸŽ‰ for celebration, âœ“ for checkmarks)
   - **Approved:** Matches modern technical documentation standards

3. **Voice Consistency:**
   - **Good:** Maintains second-person ("you") for direct address throughout
   - **Good:** Avoids anthropomorphizing ("the PR wants" - never used)

## Actionability Assessment

### Decision Support

**Strengths:**

- Decision tree provides clear framework (lines 536-680)
- Quality score thresholds clearly defined (lines 202-223)
- Each example review shows exact command used (lines 1280, 1385, 1530)

**Improvement Needed:**

- **Scenario:** Maintainer encounters quality score of 78 (border between "Acceptable" and "Needs work")
- **Current Guidance:** Implies "Request Changes" but doesn't address edge cases
- **Recommendation:** Add section "Borderline Scores (75-80)" with guidance on tiebreaker criteria

### Examples: Realistic and Helpful

**Example 1 (Excellent PR):**

- âœ“ Shows complete review structure
- âœ“ Realistic file changes (6 files, plausible line counts)
- âœ“ Includes command used (`aiwg -review-approve 123 --auto-merge`)
- **Minor issue:** Example shows 94/100 score but claims "quality gates all passed" - should clarify what caused -6 deduction

**Example 2 (Good PR):**

- âœ“ Shows constructive feedback pattern
- âœ“ Provides specific fix examples (code samples)
- âœ“ Balances criticism with praise
- **Excellent:** Shows estimated time for fixes ("15 min", "10 min")

**Example 3 (Needs Work):**

- âœ“ Shows how to request significant changes without discouraging
- âœ“ Provides architectural guidance (lines 1458-1477)
- âœ“ Offers multiple paths forward (lines 1507-1521)
- **Excellent:** Estimates total effort (4-6 hours) - sets clear expectations

### Procedure Clarity

**Can maintainers immediately apply guidance?**

**Test Case 1:** New maintainer reviews first PR
- âœ“ Prerequisites section (lines 22-70) provides setup steps
- âœ“ Command reference (lines 250-535) shows exact syntax
- âœ“ Example reviews (lines 1228-1532) show complete workflow
- **Verdict:** Yes, actionable

**Test Case 2:** Maintainer encounters security issue
- âœ“ Security section (lines 1043-1096) identifies red flags
- âœ“ Provides immediate action (line 1054)
- âš  Example comment (lines 1066-1090) is good, but doesn't show what to do for *severe* vulnerabilities (vs. minor)
- **Verdict:** Mostly actionable, needs severity triage addition

**Test Case 3:** Maintainer unsure about breaking change
- âœ“ Breaking change section (lines 975-1042) defines what qualifies
- âœ“ Shows review process (lines 985-1010)
- âœ“ Example comment (lines 1013-1041) shows team coordination
- **Verdict:** Yes, actionable

## Recommendations

## Sign-Off

**Status:** CONDITIONAL

**Conditions:**

1. Fix terminology consistency (quality gate, PR, quality score)
2. Define acronyms on first use (move earlier or add glossary)
3. Simplify decision tree section (reduce cognitive load)
4. Convert passive voice to active in Command Reference
5. Fix heading hierarchy (Special Case Decision Matrix â†’ H2)
6. Standardize code examples (remove `$` prompts)
7. Use relative paths (remove absolute paths with username)

**Rationale:**

This guide is comprehensive, well-researched, and provides excellent practical examples. The writing quality is high with appropriate tone for the maintainer audience. However, clarity improvements are needed in terminology consistency, decision-making sections, and command reference formatting. These are fixable issues that don't require content rework - just refinement.

Once conditions are met, this will be an excellent resource for AIWG maintainers.

**Estimated effort to address conditions:** 2-3 hours
