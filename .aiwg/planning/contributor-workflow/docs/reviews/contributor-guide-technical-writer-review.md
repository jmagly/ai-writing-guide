# Technical Writing Review: Contributor Quickstart Guide

**Reviewer:** Technical Writer
**Date:** 2025-10-17
**Document Version:** 0.1 (Draft)
**Review Status:** CONDITIONAL

## Summary

This contributor quickstart guide demonstrates excellent structure and comprehensive coverage of the contribution workflow. The document is well-organized with clear examples, realistic walkthroughs, and helpful troubleshooting guidance. However, several clarity, consistency, and formatting issues need attention before approval.

**Strengths:**
- Exceptional example coverage (Step-by-step walkthrough is outstanding)
- Clear command syntax with expected outputs
- Comprehensive troubleshooting section
- Logical flow from prerequisites through completion
- Excellent use of visual indicators (✓, ✗, ⚠, ⏳)

**Areas needing improvement:**
- Inconsistent terminology (Claude/Warp vs Claude Code)
- Some passive voice in process descriptions
- Minor formatting inconsistencies
- Several typos and path errors
- Missing explanations for technical assumptions

## Issues Found

### Critical (Must Fix)

1. **Typo in path** - Line 129
   - Error: `.local/share/ai-working-guide` should be `ai-writing-guide`
   - Location: Step 2, Warp command example

2. **Inconsistent tool naming** - Throughout
   - Document uses "Claude/Warp" inconsistently
   - Should establish: "Claude Code" (official name) vs "Warp Terminal"
   - First mention on line 59 is "Claude Code" but line 122 uses "Claude/Warp"

3. **Missing command flag explanation** - Line 236
   - `aiwg -contribute-test cursor-integration` introduced without prior mention of `-contribute-test`
   - User doesn't know what `-contribute-test` does beyond "validate quality"

4. **Undefined quality score calculation** - Line 244
   - "Quality Score: 95/100" appears with no context
   - Score breakdown appears later (line 924) but needs forward reference

5. **Ambiguous section reference** - Line 1128
   - Links to `[CONTRIBUTING.md](../../CONTRIBUTING.md)` with relative path
   - Path may not exist relative to `.aiwg/planning/contributor-workflow/docs/drafts/`

### Major (Should Fix)

1. **Passive voice overuse** - Lines 93-101
   - "What this does:" section uses passive extensively
   - Example: "Clones your fork to..." → "The command clones your fork to..."
   - Inconsistent with active voice used elsewhere

2. **Unexplained acronyms** - Line 19
   - "PR" used without definition
   - First definition appears at line 293 (PR = Pull Request)
   - Should define on first use: "pull request (PR)"

3. **Vague quantifier** - Line 80
   - "All commands must pass before proceeding"
   - What does "pass" mean? Exit code 0? Specific output?

4. **Unclear prerequisite** - Lines 59-66
   - "Recommended Tools" section doesn't explain why Claude Code is recommended
   - Missing: "Recommended for natural language SDLC orchestration"

5. **Missing context** - Line 118
   - "If you already have a fork..." assumes user knows what a fork is
   - Add brief explanation or link to GitHub docs

6. **Inconsistent heading style** - Various
   - Some headings use gerunds: "Working with PR Feedback" (line 367)
   - Others use imperatives: "Monitor PR Status" (line 369)
   - Choose one style and apply consistently

7. **Unclear timeout** - Line 19
   - "~30 minutes (for simple integrations)"
   - Define "simple integration" or give complexity scale

8. **Missing validation criteria** - Line 244
   - "Quality validation ensures maintainability" is vague
   - Link to quality standards section or explain briefly

### Minor (Nice to Fix)

1. **Inconsistent code block labels** - Various
   - Some code blocks have `bash` tag, others have `text`
   - Line 104 uses `text` for shell output (correct)
   - Line 28 uses `bash` for install commands (correct)
   - Be consistent: `bash` for commands, `text` for output

2. **Redundant phrasing** - Line 17
   - "Recovery is simple: `aiwg -reinstall` cleans and reclones"
   - "cleans and reclones" is redundant with "reinstall"
   - Suggest: "Recovery is simple: `aiwg -reinstall` provides a fresh installation"

3. **List punctuation inconsistency** - Lines 168-172
   - Some bullets end with periods, others don't
   - Example: Lines 168-172 have periods, but lines 240-245 don't
   - Choose one style (recommend: no periods for short phrases)

4. **Capitalization inconsistency** - Line 59
   - "Claude Code" vs "Warp Terminal" (line 62)
   - Should be "Claude Code" and "Warp" (Warp is the product name, not "Warp Terminal")

5. **Inconsistent prompt labels** - Various
   - Line 134: "Natural language prompt to Claude/Warp:"
   - Line 186: "Natural language prompt to Claude/Warp:"
   - Line 682: "Prompt to Claude:"
   - Standardize on one format

6. **Missing Oxford comma** - Line 240
   - "Markdown Lint, Manifest Sync and Documentation" (line 241-244 pattern)
   - AIWG style guide likely has stance on Oxford comma
   - Apply consistently

7. **Unclear reference** - Line 229
   - "Pro Tip" without consistent formatting
   - Consider: "**Pro Tip:**" or callout block

8. **Inconsistent emphasis** - Various
   - Some commands use bold: `**aiwg -contribute-start**`
   - Others use inline code: `aiwg -contribute-start`
   - Prefer inline code for all commands

## Clarity Improvements

### Simplify Technical Jargon

**Line 9: "dogfooding feedback loop"**
- Current: "creating a dogfooding feedback loop"
- Suggested: "using AIWG to build AIWG (dogfooding)"
- Rationale: Not all contributors know "dogfooding" term

**Line 93: "What this does:"**
- Current: Lists 7 numbered actions passively
- Suggested: Add intro sentence: "The `aiwg -contribute-start` command automates your contribution setup:"
- Rationale: Sets expectation before list

**Line 148: "What happens:"**
- Current: Passive list
- Suggested: "The intake wizard will:"
- Rationale: Active voice, clearer actor

### Add Missing Definitions

**Line 19: Time estimate**
- Add: "(simple integrations: single-file changes, low complexity)"

**Line 244: Quality score**
- Add forward reference: "(calculated based on documentation, linting, completeness—see Quality Standards section)"

**Line 80: "pass"**
- Clarify: "All commands must complete successfully (exit code 0) before proceeding"

### Improve Ambiguous Instructions

**Line 122-131: Opening in editors**
- Current: Shows two separate commands
- Suggested: Add decision criteria
  ```markdown
  **Choose your editor:**

  - **Claude Code** (recommended): Natural language SDLC orchestration
    ```bash
    claude ~/.local/share/ai-writing-guide
    ```

  - **Warp**: Terminal with AI features
    ```bash
    cd ~/.local/share/ai-writing-guide
    warp
    ```
  ```

## Consistency Fixes

### Terminology Standardization

- ❌ "Claude/Warp" (lines 59, 122, 134, 148, 186, 195)
- ✅ "Claude Code or Warp" (first mention), then "your editor" or "Claude Code" specifically

- ❌ "PR" (line 19, before definition)
- ✅ "pull request (PR)" on first use (line 19)

- ❌ Mixed: "setup command" vs "Setup command"
- ✅ Use lowercase: "setup command" (not a proper noun)

- ❌ "Warp Terminal" (line 62)
- ✅ "Warp" (official product name)

### Command Format Consistency

**Establish pattern:**
- Inline code for commands: `aiwg -contribute-start`
- Bold for emphasis in headers: **Step 1: Fork and Initialize**
- Code blocks for multi-line examples

**Apply throughout:**
- Line 89: `aiwg -contribute-start cursor-integration` ✓ (correct)
- Line 236: `aiwg -contribute-test cursor-integration` ✓ (correct)
- Maintain this pattern consistently

### Heading Hierarchy Consistency

**Current issues:**
- Line 367: "Working with PR Feedback" (H2) uses gerund
- Line 369: "Monitor PR Status" (H3) uses imperative
- Line 484: "Keeping Your Fork Updated" (H2) uses gerund

**Recommended pattern:**
- H2: Use gerunds for process sections ("Working with...", "Keeping...")
- H3: Use imperatives for action steps ("Monitor...", "Respond to...", "Sync...")
- H4: Use nouns for reference sections ("Expected Output", "Command Reference")

### List Formatting Consistency

**Bullets ending punctuation:**

Choose one style:

**Option 1: No periods for short phrases** (recommended for this guide)
```markdown
**What this does:**
- Forks repository to your account
- Clones your fork locally
- Creates feature branch
```

**Option 2: Periods for complete sentences**
```markdown
**What this does:**
- The command forks the repository to your account.
- It clones your fork locally.
- It creates a feature branch.
```

**Current document mixes both.** Recommend Option 1 for brevity.

## Structure Enhancements

### Move Quality Standards Earlier

**Current location:** Line 892 (near end of document)
**Suggested location:** After "Quick Start Workflow" (line 82)

**Rationale:** Users need to understand quality expectations before starting work. Reference minimum scores in Step 4 validation section.

**Proposed structure:**
```markdown
## Quick Start Workflow

### Quality Standards Overview

Before diving into the workflow, understand AIWG's quality expectations:

- **Minimum quality score:** 80/100 (calculated automatically)
- **Required documentation:** README update, quick-start guide
- **Linting:** All markdown must pass `markdownlint-cli2`
- **Manifests:** All `manifest.json` files synced

See [Quality Standards](#quality-standards) for complete details.

### Step 1: Fork and Initialize
...
```

### Add Navigation Aid

**Insert after Overview (line 7):**

```markdown
## Table of Contents

**Quick Navigation:**
- [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) - Required tools and setup
- [Quick Start Workflow](#quick-start-workflow) - 5 steps to your first PR
- [Example Walkthrough](#example-walkthrough-adding-cursor-integration) - Complete real-world example
- [PR Feedback](#working-with-pr-feedback) - Responding to reviews
- [Quality Standards](#quality-standards) - Validation criteria
- [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) - Common issues and solutions
- [Command Reference](#command-reference) - Quick command lookup

**Estimated time:** 30 minutes for simple integrations, 2-4 hours for complex features
```

### Improve Code Block Context

**Pattern to apply:**

Before each code block, add explanatory text stating:
1. What the command does (briefly)
2. Why you're running it
3. What to expect

**Example improvement (line 86):**

**Current:**
```markdown
### Step 1: Fork and Initialize

Start a new contribution with a single command:

```bash
aiwg -contribute-start cursor-integration
```
```

**Improved:**
```markdown
### Step 1: Fork and Initialize

Start a new contribution with a single command. This will fork the repository, create your feature branch, and set up your workspace.

```bash
aiwg -contribute-start cursor-integration
```

The command completes in 10-15 seconds and displays setup progress.
```

## Specific Line-by-Line Edits

### Line 9: Dogfooding clarification
```diff
- Contributing to AIWG is different from typical open source projects. You'll use AIWG's own SDLC framework to develop your feature - creating a dogfooding feedback loop that improves both your contribution and the framework itself.

```

## Formatting Corrections

### Heading Levels

**Current structure:**
- H1: Document title (line 1) ✓
- H2: Major sections (Overview, Prerequisites, Quick Start, etc.) ✓
- H3: Subsections (Step 1, Step 2, etc.) ✓
- H4: Details (Expected output, What this does) ✓

**No issues with heading hierarchy—well done.**

### Code Block Language Tags

**Verify all code blocks have appropriate tags:**

- Line 28: `bash` ✓
- Line 104: `text` ✓
- Line 157: `markdown` ✓
- Line 249: `text` ✓

**All code blocks properly tagged—excellent.**

### List Parallel Structure

**Line 240-245 (What this checks):**
- ✓ All items use noun phrases (parallel)

**Line 950-975 (What maintainers look for):**
- ✓ All items use noun phrases (parallel)

**Line 1186-1196 (Command reference table):**
- ⚠ Some descriptions use imperative ("Show", "Validate"), others use noun phrases ("Fresh AIWG installation")
- Suggest: Make all imperative: "Show status", "Validate quality", "Create pull request", "Install fresh AIWG"

### Table Formatting

**Line 1186: Command Reference table**

**Current:**
```markdown
| Command | Purpose | Usage |
```

**Suggested improvement (align descriptions):**

| Command | Purpose | Usage |
|---------|---------|-------|
| `aiwg -contribute-start` | Start new contribution with fork and branch setup | `aiwg -contribute-start cursor-integration` |
| `aiwg -contribute-status` | Show current contribution status | `aiwg -contribute-status cursor-integration` |
| `aiwg -contribute-test` | Validate quality before creating PR | `aiwg -contribute-test cursor-integration` |

(Apply imperative verbs consistently in "Purpose" column)

## Recommendations

### Priority 1 (Fix Before Approval)

1. Fix typo (line 129): `ai-working-guide` → `ai-writing-guide`
2. Define "PR" on first use (line 19)
3. Standardize "Claude Code" and "Warp" naming throughout
4. Add quality score context to validation section (line 244)
5. Verify relative link paths (line 1128)

### Priority 2 (Improves Usability)

1. Add table of contents after Overview
2. Move Quality Standards overview earlier (after Overview)
3. Clarify tool recommendations (why Claude Code/Warp?)
4. Add forward reference to quality score calculation
5. Standardize list punctuation (choose one style)

### Priority 3 (Polish)

1. Reduce passive voice in process descriptions
2. Standardize heading style (gerunds vs imperatives)
3. Align Command Reference table descriptions
4. Add brief fork explanation for newcomers
5. Clarify "simple integration" definition

## Sign-Off

**Status:** CONDITIONAL

**Conditions:**

1. Fix critical typo (line 129)
2. Define "PR" acronym on first use
3. Standardize terminology: "Claude Code" and "Warp"
4. Verify/fix relative documentation links
5. Add quality score context reference

**Rationale:**

This is an exceptionally well-structured and comprehensive contributor guide. The example walkthrough is outstanding, troubleshooting is thorough, and the command reference is helpful. The document demonstrates clear understanding of the target audience (first-time contributors) and provides appropriate scaffolding.

However, several terminology inconsistencies and a critical path typo need correction before approval. Once Priority 1 fixes are applied, this document will meet publication standards.

The document excels at:
- Practical, actionable guidance
- Realistic examples with complete context
- Anticipating user questions and obstacles
- Clear visual indicators for status tracking
- Comprehensive troubleshooting coverage

**Recommended next steps:**
1. Address Priority 1 issues (estimated: 15 minutes)
2. Consider Priority 2 improvements (estimated: 30 minutes)
3. Final review by Requirements Analyst (verify commands exist)
4. Final review by Software Implementer (verify command syntax)

**Approval contingent on Priority 1 fixes.**
