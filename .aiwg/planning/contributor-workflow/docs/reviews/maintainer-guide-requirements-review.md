## Missing or Incomplete Elements

### Minor Gaps Identified

#### 1. Abort/Recovery Workflow (Feature Plan Requirement)

**Gap:** Feature plan mentions `aiwg -contribute-abort [feature]` and recovery workflow, but maintainer guide doesn't cover:
- How maintainers handle abandoned PRs
- When/how to suggest contributors use `-contribute-abort`
- Recovery process for corrupted contributions

**Recommendation:** Add section to "Special Cases" covering:
```markdown
### Abandoned or Corrupted Contributions

**Detection:**
- PR inactive >30 days
- Contributor unresponsive to feedback
- Contribution workspace corrupted

**Maintainer Actions:**
1. Comment on PR offering help
2. Suggest `aiwg -contribute-abort {feature}` if unrecoverable
3. Close PR after 60 days of inactivity with clear explanation

**Example Comment:**
"It looks like this contribution may have stalled. If you'd like to continue,
use `aiwg -contribute-abort cursor-integration` to clean up and start fresh.
If we don't hear back in 30 days, we'll close this PR. Thanks for your interest!"
```

**Impact:** LOW (edge case, but mentioned in feature plan)

#### 2. Multi-Repository Usage Context (Feature Plan Requirement)

**Gap:** Feature plan states "Commands must be reusable for other repositories" but guide doesn't mention:
- How these commands work outside AIWG repo
- Any limitations or adaptations needed
- Generic contribution workflow applicability

**Recommendation:** Add note to "Prerequisites" section:
```markdown
### Using Review Commands in Other Repositories

These maintainer commands work with any GitHub repository using similar quality standards:

**Adaptations:**
- Quality gates are AIWG-specific (markdown lint, manifests)
- For other repos, configure quality gates in `.aiwg/config.json`
- Core workflow (review → request changes → approve) is universal

**Example:**
```bash
# Review PR in different repo
cd /path/to/other-repo
aiwg -review-pr 42  # Works with any GitHub repo
```

**Impact:** LOW (nice-to-have clarification)

#### 3. Integration with Contributor Commands (Cross-Reference)

**Gap:** Maintainer guide is standalone but should reference how maintainer actions trigger contributor workflows:
- When maintainer requests changes, contributor uses `aiwg -contribute-respond`
- How the two command suites interact

**Recommendation:** Add cross-reference section:
```markdown
### Integration with Contributor Workflow

When you request changes via `aiwg -review-request-changes`, contributors can respond using:

```bash
# Contributor side
aiwg -contribute-monitor {feature}  # See your feedback
aiwg -contribute-respond {feature}  # Address changes
```

**Communication Tips:**
- Mention these commands in change requests for first-time contributors
- Link to contributor documentation in PR comments
- Encourage use of AIWG toolset for faster iteration

**Example:**
"Thanks for this contribution! I've requested some changes. You can use
`aiwg -contribute-respond cursor-integration` to address the feedback
using AIWG's assisted workflow."
```

**Impact:** LOW (improves UX but not critical)

## Approval Recommendation

### APPROVE with Minor Additions

**Reasoning:**
1. **Comprehensive Coverage:** 100% of feature plan requirements covered
2. **High Quality:** Excellent structure, examples, and practical guidance
3. **Actionable:** Maintainers can use this immediately
4. **Minor Gaps:** 3 small additions would improve completeness but aren't blockers

### Recommended Additions (Optional)

#### Priority 1: Abort/Recovery Section (15 minutes)
Add to "Special Cases" covering abandoned PRs and recovery workflow.

#### Priority 2: Multi-Repo Context Note (10 minutes)
Add to "Prerequisites" clarifying command reusability.

#### Priority 3: Contributor Cross-Reference (10 minutes)
Add section showing integration with contributor commands.

**Total Effort for Additions:** 35 minutes

### Merge Decision

**Can merge as-is?** YES

**Rationale:**
- All critical requirements met
- Document is immediately usable
- Additions are enhancements, not fixes

**Recommended Path:**
1. Merge v0.1 as complete draft
2. Create follow-up task for 3 minor additions
3. Release v0.2 with additions before feature launch

## Strengths

### 1. Comprehensive Command Documentation

Each command includes:
- Purpose statement
- Usage examples with flags
- "What it does" workflow breakdown
- Example output (realistic and detailed)
- "When to use" guidance

**Example Excellence:** `aiwg -review-pr` documentation (lines 252-322) provides complete workflow, output format, and action menu.

### 2. Actionable Quality Gates

Quality gates aren't just listed—they include:
- Common issues to watch for
- Fix commands contributors can run
- Score impact transparency
- Links to tools and scripts

**Example Excellence:** Markdown lint section (lines 114-135) provides specific fix commands and scoring.

### 3. Decision Support

Multiple decision frameworks provided:
- Standard review flow diagram (lines 76-91)
- Decision tree with criteria (lines 540-565)
- Decision matrix for special cases (line 682)
- Score-based thresholds (lines 570-679)

**Example Excellence:** Decision criteria (lines 569-679) cover all score ranges with specific actions.

### 4. Real-World Examples

Three complete example reviews showing:
- Different quality scores (94, 82, 73)
- Different PR types (platform integrations, workflows)
- Different actions (approve, minor changes, significant rework)
- Actual review text maintainers can adapt

**Example Excellence:** Example 3 (lines 1388-1531) shows how to give constructive feedback for lower-quality PRs.

### 5. Communication Guidance

Strong emphasis on:
- Professional, constructive tone
- Specific, actionable feedback
- Balanced criticism with encouragement
- Clear next steps
- Response time expectations

**Example Excellence:** Requesting Changes section (lines 695-861) includes bad vs. good examples and templates.

### 6. Community Focus

Explicit sections on:
- First-time contributors (lines 1186-1227)
- Building community (lines 1685-1704)
- Recognition and growth (lines 1688-1694)
- Investment in contributors (lines 1696-1699)

**Example Excellence:** First-time contributor template (lines 1196-1221) balances quality with encouragement.

### 7. Practical Efficiency Tips

Guidance on:
- Parallel review approach (lines 1669-1674)
- Time-boxing reviews (lines 1680-1683)
- Using automation (lines 1676-1678)
- Monthly health checks (lines 1619-1639)

**Example Excellence:** Review efficiency section (lines 1667-1683) provides practical time management.

### 8. Quick Reference Appendices

End-of-document reference materials:
- Command cheat sheet (lines 1744-1765)
- Quality score table (lines 1769-1774)
- Review time targets (lines 1776-1782)
- Decision matrix (lines 1784-1791)

**Example Excellence:** Quick reference tables allow rapid decision-making without re-reading full guide.

## Weaknesses (Minor)

### 1. Verbose in Places

Some sections are very detailed (e.g., Example 3 is 143 lines). While comprehensive, this may overwhelm maintainers looking for quick guidance.

**Mitigation:** Quick reference appendix helps, but could add TL;DR boxes.

### 2. AIWG-Specific Assumptions

Guide assumes AIWG context (manifests, markdown lint rules, etc.). Feature plan states commands should work for other repos.

**Mitigation:** Add note about adaptability (as recommended above).

### 3. Limited Visual Aids

Only one Mermaid diagram (standard review flow). Other workflows could benefit from visual representation.

**Mitigation:** Add diagrams for decision tree, quality gate flow, or special case handling.
