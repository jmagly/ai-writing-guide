###

About [Company Name]
[Boilerplate: 3-5 sentences describing the company, its mission, key

### Headline Best Practices

**Effective Headlines:**

- "Acme Corp Raises $50M Series B to Expand AI-Powered Manufacturing Platform"
- "New Study Reveals 73% of Consumers Prefer Sustainable Packaging"
- "TechStart Launches Industry's First Zero-Configuration API Integration Tool"

**Weak Headlines:**

- ❌ "Game-Changing Innovation Disrupts Market" (hyperbolic, no substance)

### Quote Best Practices

**Strong Quotes (provide context, emotion, vision):**

```text
"Small businesses waste 15 hours per week on manual invoicing. We built
InvoiceAI to give them those hours back so they can focus on growing
their business," said Jane Smith, CEO of InvoiceAI. "This funding allows
us to bring that time savings to 100,000 more businesses this year."
```

**Weak Quotes (generic, could be anyone):**

```text
❌ "We're excited about this partnership and look forward to working together,"
said John Doe, CEO.
```

### Interview Best Practices

**Before the Interview:**

- Rehearse key messages and Q&A
- Prepare 2-3 quotable soundbites (10-15 seconds each)

- Speak in soundbites (short, complete thoughts)
- Use concrete examples and data
- Pause before answering (think, don't rush)
- Assume everything is on the record
- Don't say "no comment" (use bridge instead)

**After the Interview:**

- Send thank-you email with any promised follow-up info
- Clarify any quotes if necessary (immediately)
- Don't ask to review article before publication (major faux pas)
- Share coverage with team once published
