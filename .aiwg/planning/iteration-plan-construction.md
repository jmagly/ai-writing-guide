## Implementation Order: Epic → Value → Risk

### Phase 1: Epic-First (Weeks 1-4) - Test Infrastructure Foundation

**Goal**: Establish test infrastructure and enable TDD for all subsequent development

**Epic**: #7 (EPIC-7: Test Infrastructure & Artifact Generation)

**Issues** (6 components):

1. **#16 (T-010)**: PerformanceProfiler (4-6h) - **✅ COMPLETE**
2. **#22 (T-011)**: MockAgentOrchestrator (4-6h) - **✅ COMPLETE**
3. **#23 (T-012)**: GitSandbox (3-5h) - **✅ COMPLETE**
4. **#24 (T-013)**: GitHubAPIStub (3-4h)
5. **#25 (T-014)**: FilesystemSandbox (2-3h)
6. **#26 (T-015)**: TestDataFactory (3-4h)

**NFR Validation Infrastructure** (3 components):

7. **#36 (T-018)**: NFR Ground Truth Corpus Management (8-10h) - **CRITICAL FOR NFR VALIDATION**
8. **#38 (T-020)**: NFR Acceptance Test Suite Generator (10-12h) - **BLOCKS CONSTRUCTION GATE**

**FID-007 Testing** (foundation):

9. **#21 (T-007)**: Complete FID-007 Testing (20-25h, 117 unit tests) - **BLOCKS PLUGIN DEVELOPMENT**

**Plugin System Foundation** (critical for development):

10. **#33 (T-017)**: Plugin Metadata Validation + CI/CD (6-8h) - **BLOCKS ALL PLUGIN WORK**
11. **#32 (T-016)**: Workspace Migration CLI (10-12h) - **REQUIRED FOR EXISTING USERS**

**Total Effort**: 73-99 hours (11 issues)

**Rationale**: Test infrastructure enables TDD for all subsequent work. NFR validation infrastructure ensures Construction gate criteria can be met. FID-007 testing validates foundation for plugin system. Metadata validation unblocks plugin development.

## Risks and Mitigation

### High-Risk Areas

#### 1. Requirements Traceability Complexity (#12)

**Risk**: Complex graph algorithms may be harder than estimated (15-20h)

**Mitigation**:

- Start with simple bidirectional linking
- Incrementally add orphan detection
- Use existing graph libraries (graphlib.js)
- Break down into smaller tasks if needed

#### 2. Multi-Agent Orchestration (#11)

**Risk**: Coordination complexity may exceed estimate (15-20h)

**Mitigation**:

- ✅ MockAgentOrchestrator ready for testing
- ✅ Multi-agent pattern validated (3x speedup achieved Week 1)
- Start with simple sequential workflows
- Add parallel execution incrementally

#### 3. Plugin Rollback Safety (#19)

**Risk**: Transactional rollback may be complex (8-10h)

**Mitigation**:

- Use simplified reset + redeploy strategy (ADR-006)
- ✅ GitSandbox ready for testing
- Validate data integrity at every step
- FID-007 foundation already delivered

#### 4. Security Validation Accuracy (#20)

**Risk**: False positive/negative rates may be hard to achieve (12-15h)

**Mitigation**:

- Use ground truth corpus for validation (#36)
- Start with high-confidence patterns (secrets, external APIs)
- Incrementally add complex patterns
- Accept higher false positive rate initially (tune over time)

### Schedule Risks

#### 1. Velocity Uncertainty ✅ MITIGATED

**Risk**: Actual velocity may be lower than 15h/week

**Mitigation**:

- ✅ Week 1 validated: 11-17h in single day using multi-agent orchestration
- ✅ 3x velocity boost confirmed (parallel execution)
- Continue tracking actuals weekly
- Adjust estimates based on continued validation

#### 2. Scope Creep

**Risk**: Additional features may be requested during Construction

**Mitigation**:

- Lock P0 scope (34 issues)
- Defer all new features to P1/P2
- Use change control process (CCB)
- Focus on MVP completion

#### 3. Technical Debt ✅ ADDRESSED

**Risk**: Test coverage may slip under schedule pressure

**Mitigation**:

- ✅ Test infrastructure first (3 components complete)
- ✅ Week 1 exceeded coverage targets (98.62% vs 80% target)
- TDD for all subsequent work
- Automated coverage reporting in place
