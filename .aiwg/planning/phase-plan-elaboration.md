**Next Phase**: Construction (Planned Week 15+)

## Executive Summary

**Phase Objective**: Refine architecture through enhancement plan execution, triage feature backlog, elaborate detailed requirements, and achieve Architecture Baseline Milestone (ABM) ready for Construction phase.

**CRITICAL CHANGE**: FID-007 (Framework-Scoped Workspace Management) elevated to P0 #1 priority, blocking all other features. Timeline extended from 8 weeks to 10 weeks to accommodate.

**Strategic Purpose**: Elaboration transforms the comprehensive Inception baseline (SAD v1.0 + 6 ADRs) into production-ready architecture through:
1. **FID-007 Workspace Management** (80 hours, Week 2-4 roadmap) - **NEW P0 BLOCKER**
2. **Security Enhancement Execution** (89 hours, Week 5-7 roadmap) - **Shifted from Week 1-4**
3. **Testability Enhancement Execution** (80 hours, 10-week roadmap - 80% completion target)
4. **Requirements Elaboration** (5 use case briefs → 11+ full specifications including UC-012)
5. **Feature Backlog Triage** (23 ideas → 7 P0 features prioritized)
6. **Risk Retirement** (PoCs for high-risk features)

**Timeline**: 10 weeks (November 14, 2025 - January 22, 2026) - **Extended +2 weeks for FID-007**
**Team**: Solo developer (Joseph Magly) with multi-agent orchestration support
**Budget**: $0 (open source, volunteer effort)
**Risk Profile**: Medium (2 active risks requiring monitoring)

**Success Criteria Summary**:
- 100% FID-007 workspace management implementation (3 weeks, 80 hours) - **CRITICAL BLOCKER**
- 100% security enhancement plan execution (3 weeks, 89 hours) - **Shifted to Week 5-7**
- 80%+ testability enhancement plan execution (8 of 10 weeks minimum, defer final 2 weeks to Construction if needed)
- 11+ use case specifications complete with acceptance criteria (including UC-012 for FID-007)
- Supplemental Specification (NFRs) baselined (with 4 FID-007 NFRs: PERF-09, USE-07, MAINT-08, REL-07)
- Feature backlog prioritized (7 P0 features ranked, FID-007 as #1)
- Architecture stability: <15% changes from SAD v1.0 (ADR-007 workspace architecture added)
- Risk retirement: ≥75% (maintain or improve from Inception's 75%)

**Key Deliverables**:
1. **FID-007 Workspace Management** (Week 2-4, 80 hours) - **NEW #1 PRIORITY**
2. Security enhancements complete (Week 5-7, 89-hour plan executed)
3. Testability enhancements substantial progress (80%+ complete)
4. 11+ Use Case Specifications (expanded from 5 briefs + UC-012)
5. Supplemental Specification v1.1 (NFRs + FID-007 workspace NFRs)
6. Feature backlog v1.1 prioritized (7 P0, 10 P1, 7 P2)
7. 2-3 POCs complete (validate high-risk features)
8. Architecture Baseline Milestone (ABM) Report

**Critical Path**: FID-007 Implementation (Week 2-4) → Security Plan (Week 5-7) → Requirements Elaboration (Week 2-3) → Testability Plan (Week 1-10) → POCs (Week 6-7) → ABM Gate Review (Week 10)

## 1. Phase Overview

### 1.1 Vision and Context

From Inception Gate Review Report:

> **Gate Decision**: PASS (UNCONDITIONAL) - All 6 gate criteria MET (100%). Framework proven operational through self-application. Quality scores exceed targets by +14.1% (91.3/100 vs 80/100). Velocity 2-3x faster than estimated (2 days vs 14-day target). Architecture baseline comprehensive (SAD v1.0 95/100 + 6 ADRs 88.3/100 avg).

**Why Elaboration Phase Matters**:
- **Architecture Refinement**: Execute enhancement plans to raise security (78→90+) and testability (86→95+) scores
- **Requirements Depth**: Transform high-level vision into detailed, testable specifications
- **Risk Retirement**: Build PoCs for highest-risk features to validate architectural assumptions
- **Construction Readiness**: Deliver stable architecture baseline ready for feature implementation

**What Makes This Phase Unique**:
- **Enhancement Execution Focus**: Unlike typical Elaboration (architecture creation), we're refining already-complete architecture
- **Parallel Tracks**: Security + testability + requirements elaboration running concurrently
- **Velocity Validation**: Proving AIWG framework enables sustainable 15 hours/week pace
- **Community Preparation**: Elaboration deliverables enable Phase 3 community contributions

### 1.2 Objectives

**Primary Objective**: **Execute Enhancement Plans and Elaborate Requirements**

Complete security enhancement plan (89h, 4 weeks) and substantial testability enhancement plan progress (80h, 8+ of 10 weeks), while elaborating 10+ detailed use case specifications and NFRs.

**Success Metrics**:
- ✅ 100% security enhancement plan execution (all 5 high-priority vulnerabilities addressed)
- ✅ 80%+ testability enhancement plan execution (8 of 10 weeks minimum, defer Weeks 9-10 if needed)
- ✅ 10+ use case specifications complete (expand from 5 briefs in Vision)
- ✅ Supplemental Specification (NFRs) baselined

**Secondary Objective**: **Prioritize Feature Backlog and Retire Risks**

Triage 23 feature ideas using decision matrix, select top 5-10 for Construction, and build PoCs for highest-risk features.

**Success Metrics**:
- ✅ Feature backlog prioritized (decision matrix applied, top 5-10 selected)
- ✅ 2-3 POCs complete (validate high-risk architectural assumptions)
- ✅ Risk retirement: ≥75% (maintain or improve from Inception)
- ✅ Architecture stability: <10% changes from SAD v1.0

**Tertiary Objective**: **Achieve Architecture Baseline Milestone (ABM)**

Deliver comprehensive ABM Report demonstrating architecture readiness for Construction phase.

**Success Metrics**:
- ✅ ABM gate criteria met (100% of requirements addressed or deferred with rationale)
- ✅ Stakeholder signoff obtained (maintainer approval)
- ✅ Transition readiness assessment complete
- ✅ Construction phase plan drafted

### 1.3 Scope

**What We're Building in Elaboration**:
- Security enhancements to existing plugin system architecture
- Testability improvements to existing framework components
- Detailed requirements specifications (use cases, NFRs)
- Proof-of-concepts for high-risk features
- Feature backlog prioritization (not implementation)

**Evidence of Inception Success**:
- SAD v1.0 BASELINED (95/100 quality, 12,847 words, 10 diagrams)
- 6 ADRs complete (all 85+/100 quality)
- Security enhancement plan ready (4-week roadmap, 89 hours)
- Testability enhancement plan ready (10-week roadmap, 80 hours)
- Feature backlog captured (23 ideas awaiting triage)

**In Scope (Must-Have for ABM Gate)**:

**FID-007: Framework-Scoped Workspace Management** (Week 2-4, 80 hours) - **CRITICAL BLOCKER**:
- ✅ Week 2: Framework registry system, metadata schema design
- ✅ Week 3: Workspace tier management (4-tier architecture), natural language routing logic
- ✅ Week 3-4: Command/agent metadata standards, write path validation
- ✅ Week 4: Migration tooling for existing `.aiwg/` artifacts, integration testing

**Justification**: FID-007 blocks all other P0 features due to workspace dependencies. Without framework-scoped directories, security enhancements and other features will write artifacts to wrong locations, causing context pollution and organizational chaos. Must complete before proceeding with remaining feature development.

**Security Enhancements** (Week 5-7, 89 hours) - **Shifted from Week 1-4**:
- ✅ Week 5-6: YAML safe parsing, path traversal prevention
- ✅ Week 6: Lifecycle hooks removal (ADR-002 alignment), dependency verification
- ✅ Week 7: Injection validation, secrets detection
- ✅ Week 7: ADR-002 updates, Security View documentation

**Testability Enhancements** (8+ of 10 weeks, 64+ hours minimum):
- ✅ Weeks 1-2: Rollback strategy implementation (transaction-based, <5s target)
- ✅ Weeks 3-4: Performance baselines (NFR validation infrastructure)
- ✅ Weeks 5-6: Test data catalog (50+ fixtures)
- ✅ Weeks 7-8: E2E scenarios (12+ comprehensive workflows)
- ⏳ Weeks 9-10: DEFER to Construction if schedule pressure (integration refinement, security/compatibility testing)

**Requirements Elaboration** (Weeks 2-3):
- Expand 5 use case briefs to full specifications with:
  - Actors and preconditions
  - Main success scenario (step-by-step)
  - Extensions and error handling
  - Acceptance criteria
  - Non-functional requirements
- Create 5+ additional use case specifications (total 10+)
- Draft Supplemental Specification (NFRs):
  - Performance requirements
  - Security requirements
  - Usability requirements
  - Reliability requirements
  - Maintainability requirements

**Feature Backlog Triage** (Week 1):
- Apply decision matrix to 23 feature ideas:
  - Business value (1-5 scale)
  - Implementation effort (1-5 scale)
  - Risk level (1-5 scale)
  - Strategic alignment (1-5 scale)
- Prioritize using weighted scoring
- Select top 5-10 features for Construction
- Defer remaining ideas to future phases

**Proof-of-Concepts** (Weeks 4-5):
- Build 2-3 POCs for highest-risk features:
  - Example: Plugin rollback mechanism (transaction-based)
  - Example: Multi-platform platform abstraction
  - Example: Automated traceability engine
- Validate architectural assumptions
- Document learnings in ADRs (if architecture changes needed)

**Architecture Refinement** (continuous):
- Update SAD and ADRs based on enhancement plan learnings
- Document architecture decisions from POCs
- Maintain <10% change threshold (stability validation)

**Testing and Validation** (Weeks 6-7):
- Execute test strategy on existing framework components
- Validate architecture through steel thread implementations
- Conduct multi-agent architecture review (internal + peer review)

**Documentation**:
- ✅ Elaboration phase plan (this document)
- ✅ 10+ use case specifications
- ✅ Supplemental Specification (NFRs)
- ✅ Feature backlog (prioritized)
- ✅ POC reports (2-3 documents)
- ✅ ABM Report (gate review document)
- ⏳ Updated README (if architecture changes require)
- ⏳ CHANGELOG entry (Elaboration phase completion)

**Out of Scope (Deferred to Construction or Later)**:
- Feature implementation (Construction phase)
- Production deployment (Transition phase)
- Community contributor onboarding (Phase 3)
- Multi-platform expansion beyond Claude Code (validate demand first)
- Enterprise templates (GDPR, SOC2, HIPAA) - await enterprise user validation
- Advanced quality gates (SAST/DAST, performance regression testing)
- Cross-platform validation (macOS, Windows) - Linux focus for Elaboration

**Scope Management**:
- **Ruthless Prioritization**: If velocity drops, defer testability Weeks 9-10 to Construction
- **Quality Over Quantity**: Better 8 excellent use cases than 15 mediocre ones
- **Time Boxing**: POCs capped at 1 week each; simplify if complexity exceeds estimate
- **Emergency Simplification**: If Week 6 shows schedule risk, reduce POC count from 3 to 2

- **Medium Confidence (70-90%)**: FID-007 workspace management (new feature, 80-hour estimate may shift ±10%), testability enhancements (8 of 10 weeks target allows buffer), POCs (unknowns in validation), architecture review (consensus risk)
- **Lower Confidence (50-70%)**: 100% testability completion (may defer Weeks 9-10 to Construction if schedule pressure), FID-007 migration tooling complexity (unknown edge cases)

### 1.6 Constraints and Assumptions

**Constraints**:

**Resource Constraints**:
- **Solo Developer**: Joseph Magly is single contributor, 100% of development capacity
- **Time Availability**: Target 15 hours/week average (sustainable based on Inception learnings)
- **Zero Budget**: No paid tools, infrastructure, or external resources
- **GitHub Free Tier**: 2000 CI/CD minutes/month limit (must stay within)

**Technical Constraints**:
- **Backward Compatibility**: Enhancements must not break existing installations
- **Architecture Stability**: <10% changes from SAD v1.0 (excessive changes indicate Inception gap)
- **Multi-Platform Deferral**: Claude Code only until multi-platform demand validates
- **Manual Testing Priority**: Automated tests secondary to enhancement plan execution

**Schedule Constraints**:
- **8-Week Timeline**: Fixed Elaboration duration (can extend 2-4 weeks max if critical gaps)
- **Construction Dependency**: Features cannot begin until ABM gate passed
- **Holiday Season**: December holidays may reduce weekly capacity (plan buffer)

**Assumptions**:

**Critical Assumptions (High Risk if Wrong)**:

**Assumption 1: Enhancement Plans Are Accurate**
- **Assumption**: Security (89h) and testability (80h) effort estimates are realistic
- **Evidence**: Plans created by specialized agents with domain expertise
- **Validation**: Track actual hours weekly, compare to estimates
- **Risk if Wrong**: Elaboration extends beyond 8 weeks, schedule slippage
- **Mitigation**: Monitor weekly, adjust scope (defer testability Weeks 9-10 if needed)

**Assumption 2: Maintainer Workload Sustainable at 15 Hours/Week**
- **Assumption**: Solo developer can sustain 15 hours/week average over 8-week Elaboration
- **Evidence**: Inception achieved 14.5 hours/week (within target)
- **Validation**: Track time weekly, monitor burnout signals
- **Risk if Wrong**: Maintainer burnout, project delays or abandonment
- **Mitigation**: Ruthless prioritization, "maintenance only" periods if workload spikes

**Assumption 3: Multi-Agent Pattern Maintains Efficiency**
- **Assumption**: Using AIWG agents for requirements, reviews, synthesis continues to save 50%+ effort
- **Evidence**: Inception demonstrated +10-15 point quality improvements, 2-3x velocity
- **Validation**: Measure time for use case elaboration vs manual drafting
- **Risk if Wrong**: Requirements elaboration consumes excessive time, schedule pressure
- **Mitigation**: Simplify requirements if agent overhead exceeds 20% of artifact generation time

**Supporting Assumptions (Lower Risk)**:

**Assumption 4: Architecture Stability Maintained**
- **Assumption**: Enhancement plans refine (not rewrite) existing architecture, <10% change threshold
- **Evidence**: Plans address specific gaps, not fundamental design flaws
- **Validation**: Track SAD section changes, count modified vs total sections
- **Risk if Wrong**: Architecture instability indicates Inception gaps, may require re-baseline
- **Mitigation**: Monthly architecture review, escalate if changes exceed 5% in any single week

**Assumption 5: POCs Validate Assumptions**
- **Assumption**: 2-3 POCs sufficient to retire top architectural risks
- **Evidence**: Inception identified specific high-risk features (rollback, multi-platform, traceability)
- **Validation**: Risk register updated after each POC, retirement percentage tracked
- **Risk if Wrong**: Unvalidated risks emerge in Construction, implementation delays
- **Mitigation**: Prioritize highest-risk POCs first, add 4th POC if new critical risk identified

**Assumption 6: Feature Backlog Triage Is Decisive**
- **Assumption**: Decision matrix provides clear prioritization, top 5-10 features emerge
- **Evidence**: Option matrix pattern proven in Inception (solution-profile.md)
- **Validation**: Maintainer reviews priorities, validates strategic alignment
- **Risk if Wrong**: Ambiguous priorities, Construction planning difficult
- **Mitigation**: Include "strategic alignment" weight in decision matrix, maintainer tie-breaking

**Assumption Validation Plan**:
- **Weekly Reviews**: Assess critical assumptions 1-3 in retrospectives
- **Metrics Dashboard**: Track velocity, enhancement plan progress, maintainer workload
- **Risk Escalation**: If any critical assumption invalidated, escalate to Project Owner for scope/timeline adjustment

## 3. Risk Management

### 3.1 Active Risks from Inception

From Risk Register (`.aiwg/risks/risk-register.md`):

**R-PROC-01: Process Overhead Kills Velocity** - MEDIUM RISK (Inception: HIGH, downgraded)
- **Status**: MITIGATED (Inception velocity 2-3x faster than estimated)
- **Elaboration Mitigation**: Continue multi-agent pattern for requirements, track weekly velocity
- **Monitoring**: Weekly retrospectives assess if <15 hours/week maintained

**R-RES-01: Solo Maintainer Burnout** - MEDIUM RISK (Inception: CRITICAL, downgraded)
- **Status**: MITIGATED (Inception 14.5 hours/week sustainable)
- **Elaboration Mitigation**: Target 15 hours/week average, ruthless prioritization
- **Monitoring**: Track hours weekly, watch for burnout signals (frustration, delays)

### 3.2 New Risks for Elaboration

**R-ELAB-01: Enhancement Plan Execution Slippage** - MEDIUM RISK
- **Description**: Security (89h, 4 weeks) and testability (80h, 10 weeks) plans slip due to underestimated complexity
- **Probability**: Medium (plans created by experts, but unknowns exist)
- **Impact**: Medium (slippage extends Elaboration, doesn't block Construction if 80% threshold met)
- **Mitigation**:
  - Track cumulative hours weekly (security target 22.25h/week, testability 8h/week)
  - Monitor progress against milestones (security Week 1-4, testability Week 1-8)
  - Adjust scope if slippage detected (defer testability Weeks 9-10 to Construction)
  - Escalate if security plan slips (critical for ABM gate)
- **Owner**: Project Manager
- **Status**: ACTIVE - Weekly monitoring in retrospectives

**R-ELAB-02: Testability Plan Incompletion** - LOW RISK
- **Description**: Testability plan Weeks 9-10 deferred to Construction if schedule pressure
- **Probability**: Low (8 of 10 weeks achievable in 8-week Elaboration)
- **Impact**: Low (80% completion sufficient for ABM gate, final 20% Construction work)
- **Mitigation**:
  - Establish 80% threshold as acceptable (8 of 10 weeks)
  - Prioritize critical testability work in Weeks 1-8 (rollback, performance, test data, E2E)
  - Defer lower-priority work to Weeks 9-10 (integration refinement, security/compatibility testing)
  - Document deferral rationale in ABM Report
- **Owner**: Test Architect
- **Status**: PLANNED - Threshold defined, deferral acceptable

**R-ELAB-03: POC Validation Failures** - MEDIUM RISK
- **Description**: POCs reveal architectural assumptions invalid, require SAD redesign
- **Probability**: Medium (POCs test unvalidated assumptions)
- **Impact**: High (architecture instability, may require re-entering Inception)
- **Mitigation**:
  - Prioritize highest-risk POCs first (rollback, multi-platform, traceability)
  - Time box POCs to 1 week maximum (detect issues early)
  - Track SAD changes (escalate if >5% in single week)
  - Conduct architecture review after POCs (multi-agent validation)
- **Owner**: Architecture Designer
- **Status**: ACTIVE - POC Week 4-5, monitor closely

**R-ELAB-04: Requirements Overload** - LOW RISK
- **Description**: Creating 10+ use case specifications in Weeks 2-3 overwhelms maintainer
- **Probability**: Low (multi-agent pattern proven in Inception)
- **Impact**: Medium (schedule slippage, but not gate-blocking)
- **Mitigation**:
  - Use requirements-analyst agent for drafting (efficiency gain)
  - Prioritize top 5-10 features from backlog triage (focus on critical)
  - Accept 8-10 use cases if quality >quantity trade-off needed
  - Multi-agent review ensures quality maintained
- **Owner**: Requirements Analyst
- **Status**: PLANNED - Week 2-3 execution, monitor workload

**R-ELAB-05: Holiday Season Capacity Reduction** - LOW RISK
- **Description**: December holidays reduce weekly capacity below 15 hours/week target
- **Probability**: Medium (expected seasonal impact)
- **Impact**: Low (schedule buffer in Weeks 6-7 accommodates reduced capacity)
- **Mitigation**:
  - Plan lighter workload for Weeks 6-7 (testing and validation, not heavy development)
  - Accept <15 hours/week during holidays (average over full 8 weeks)
  - Use holiday weeks for review and synthesis (less coding-intensive work)
- **Owner**: Project Manager
- **Status**: PLANNED - Buffer built into schedule

### 3.3 Risk Monitoring and Escalation

**Weekly Risk Reviews**:
- Assess top 5 Elaboration risks in weekly retrospectives
- Track mitigation effectiveness (actions taken, results observed)
- Identify new risks emerging (POC learnings, enhancement plan issues)

**Escalation Criteria**:
- Security enhancement plan slips >1 week: Escalate to Project Owner (may require ABM extension)
- Testability plan <60% complete by Week 6: Escalate, assess gate readiness
- POC reveals show-stopper architectural flaw: Escalate, may require Inception re-entry
- Maintainer workload exceeds 20 hours/week for 2+ consecutive weeks: Escalate, reduce scope

**Risk Retirement Tracking**:
- Inception baseline: 75% risk retirement
- Elaboration target: ≥75% (maintain or improve)
- POCs retire 3 high-risk assumptions (rollback, multi-platform, traceability)
- Enhancement plans retire security and testability risks

**Traceability Validation**:
- 100% requirements mapped to architecture (no orphaned requirements)
- 100% architecture decisions traced to requirements (no arbitrary choices)
- POCs validate high-risk architectural assumptions (risk retirement)
- Construction features directly implement prioritized use cases

## 9. Conclusion

The Elaboration phase transforms AIWG's comprehensive Inception baseline into a production-ready architecture through focused enhancement execution, detailed requirements elaboration, and risk retirement via proof-of-concepts.

**Critical Success Factors**:
1. **Enhancement Plan Execution**: Security (100%, 4 weeks) and Testability (80%+, 8 weeks) plans executed on schedule
2. **Requirements Depth**: 10+ use case specifications with acceptance criteria, Supplemental Specification baselined
3. **Architecture Stability**: <10% changes from SAD v1.0 (refinement, not redesign)
4. **Risk Retirement**: ≥75% maintained, 3 POCs validate high-risk assumptions
5. **Sustainable Pace**: ≤15 hours/week average maintained over 8 weeks

**Key Transitions**:
- **From Inception**: Leverage complete architecture baseline (SAD v1.0 + 6 ADRs)
- **To Construction**: Deliver stable architecture, detailed requirements, and validated assumptions ready for feature implementation

**Next Steps**:
1. Obtain maintainer approval for Elaboration phase plan (November 14, 2025)
2. Execute Week 1: Feature backlog triage, security enhancements kickoff, use cases 1-2 (November 14-20)
3. Track progress weekly via retrospectives, adjust as needed
4. Conduct ABM gate review (January 8, 2026)
5. Transition to Construction phase upon ABM PASS

**Accountability**: Project Manager drives Elaboration execution, Project Owner (Joseph Magly) approves all major decisions and deliverables.
