### 3.3 Asset Download Patterns

#### Pattern 1: Direct Download Links

**Implementation**:
```html
<a href="https://cdn.company.com/assets/logo.svg" download="company-logo.svg">
  Download SVG Logo
</a>
```

**Advantages**:
- Simplest implementation
- No server-side processing
- Fast (no redirect or processing delay)

**Disadvantages**:
- No download tracking
- No license acceptance workflow
- Direct file URL exposure (can be shared/hotlinked)

**Best For**: Low-sensitivity assets (logos, basic photos)

#### Pattern 2: Server-Side Download Handler

**Implementation**:
```javascript
// API endpoint: /api/download/{assetId}
app.get('/api/download/:assetId', async (req, res) => {
  const asset = await getAssetById(req.params.assetId);

  // Track download
  await logDownload(asset, req);

  // Stream file
  res.download(asset.filePath, asset.fileName);
});
```

**Advantages**:
- Download tracking (analytics)
- Access control (check permissions)
- Dynamic file serving (choose format based on request)
- Obfuscate direct file URLs

**Disadvantages**:
- Server processing overhead
- Slightly slower than direct download

**Best For**: All commercial use, sensitive assets, need for analytics

#### Pattern 3: Signed/Expiring URLs

**Implementation**:
```javascript
// Generate temporary signed URL (AWS S3 example)
const AWS = require('aws-sdk');
const s3 = new AWS.S3();

const signedUrl = s3.getSignedUrl('getObject', {
  Bucket: 'company-assets',
  Key: 'logo.svg',
  Expires: 3600 // 1 hour expiration
});

// Return signed URL to client
res.json({ downloadUrl: signedUrl });
```

**Advantages**:
- Secure (URL expires, can't be shared long-term)
- Offload bandwidth (direct from S3, not origin server)
- Access control (generate only for authorized users)

**Disadvantages**:
- More complex implementation
- Requires CDN/object storage

**Best For**: Embargoed content, high-value assets, large file sizes

#### Pattern 4: Bulk Download (ZIP Generation)

**On-Demand ZIP**:
```javascript
const archiver = require('archiver');

app.get('/api/download-collection/:collectionId', async (req, res) => {
  const assets = await getCollectionAssets(req.params.collectionId);

  res.attachment('media-kit.zip');
  const archive = archiver('zip', { zlib: { level: 9 }});
  archive.pipe(res);

  assets.forEach(asset => {
    archive.file(asset.filePath, { name: asset.fileName });
  });

  await archive.finalize();
});
```

**Pre-Generated ZIP**:
- Cron job generates ZIPs for common collections (nightly)
- Serve pre-generated file (faster than on-demand)
- Regenerate when collection contents change

**Advantages**:
- User convenience (single download for multiple files)
- Organized file structure (folders within ZIP)

**Disadvantages**:
- Processing time (large ZIPs)
- Bandwidth (larger file size)

**Best For**: Press kits, brand asset packages, event media

#### Pattern 5: Streaming Download (Large Files)

**Implementation**:
```javascript
const fs = require('fs');

app.get('/api/download-video/:videoId', async (req, res) => {
  const video = await getVideoById(req.params.videoId);

  const stat = fs.statSync(video.filePath);
  const fileSize = stat.size;
  const range = req.headers.range;

  if (range) {
    // Partial content (resumable download)
    const parts = range.replace(/bytes=/, "").split("-");
    const start = parseInt(parts[0], 10);
    const end = parts[1] ? parseInt(parts[1], 10) : fileSize - 1;
    const chunksize = (end - start) + 1;
    const file = fs.createReadStream(video.filePath, {start, end});

    res.writeHead(206, {
      'Content-Range': `bytes ${start}-${end}/${fileSize}`,
      'Accept-Ranges': 'bytes',
      'Content-Length': chunksize,
      'Content-Type': 'video/mp4',
    });

    file.pipe(res);
  } else {
    // Full file
    res.writeHead(200, {
      'Content-Length': fileSize,
      'Content-Type': 'video/mp4',
    });
    fs.createReadStream(video.filePath).pipe(res);
  }
});
```

**Advantages**:
- Resumable downloads (if connection drops)
- Progressive streaming (start playback before full download)
- Bandwidth efficient (stream chunks as needed)

**Best For**: Video files, large documents, slow connections

#### Pattern 6: Progressive Web App (Offline Access)

**Implementation**:
- Service worker caches critical assets
- User can browse previously viewed assets offline
- Queue downloads for when connection restored

**Use Case**: Journalists traveling (planes, remote areas)

**Advantages**:
- Works offline
- Faster repeat visits (cached assets)

**Disadvantages**:
- Complex implementation
- Browser support variations

### 3.4 Embargo and Access Control

#### Embargo Management

**Definition**: Releasing information to select media under agreement not to publish until specified date/time.

**Use Cases**:
- Major product launches (give journalists time to prepare in-depth coverage)
- Executive announcements (coordinate across time zones)
- Earnings reports (ensure simultaneous public disclosure)
- Sensitive news (legal/regulatory coordination)

#### Embargo Implementation

**Workflow**:

1. **Create Embargoed Content**
   - Draft press release, assets
   - Set embargo lift date/time (with timezone)
   - Mark as "Embargoed" in CMS

2. **Grant Access**
   - Invite journalists (email list)
   - Send unique access links (one-time use or time-limited)
   - Include embargo terms in invitation

3. **Journalist Access**
   - Click link (authenticates automatically or requires password)
   - View content, download assets
   - Agree to embargo terms (checkbox acknowledgment)
   - Receive reminder notification (24 hours before lift)

4. **Embargo Lift**
   - Automatic publication at specified time
   - Remove access restrictions
   - Archive embargo acknowledgments (compliance record)

**Technical Implementation**:

```javascript
// Embargo content model
{
  contentId: "press-release-123",
  title: "Major Product Launch",
  embargoUntil: "2024-12-01T09:00:00-05:00", // ISO 8601 with timezone
  status: "embargoed", // embargoed | live | expired
  accessList: [
    {
      email: "journalist@publication.com",
      accessToken: "unique-token-abc123",
      acceptedTerms: true,
      acceptedAt: "2024-11-28T14:32:00Z"
    }
  ]
}

// Access control middleware
app.get('/embargoed/:contentId', async (req, res) => {
  const content = await getEmbargoedContent(req.params.contentId);
  const token = req.query.token;

  // Check if embargo lifted
  if (new Date() >= new Date(content.embargoUntil)) {
    return res.redirect(`/newsroom/${content.contentId}`);
  }

  // Verify access token
  const access = content.accessList.find(a => a.accessToken === token);
  if (!access) {
    return res.status(403).send('Invalid access token');
  }

  // Require terms acceptance
  if (!access.acceptedTerms) {
    return res.render('embargo-terms', { content, token });
  }

  // Grant access
  res.render('embargoed-content', { content });
});
```

#### Access Control Strategies

**Strategy 1: Public (No Restrictions)**

Use For:
- General press releases
- Standard media kit assets
- Evergreen content

Implementation:
- No authentication required
- SEO-indexed (appear in search results)
- Shareable links

**Strategy 2: Password-Protected**

Use For:
- Embargoed content
- Partner-only resources
- Beta/pre-release information

Implementation:
```html
<!-- Simple password gate -->
<form action="/verify-password" method="post">
  <input type="password" name="password" placeholder="Enter access password">
  <button type="submit">Access Content</button>
</form>
```

Advanced:
- Different passwords for different groups (tier 1 media vs tier 2)
- Password expiration (change after embargo lifts)
- Session-based access (password required once, then cookie-based)

**Strategy 3: Email-Gated**

Use For:
- Lead generation (research reports, white papers)
- Audience segmentation (track which outlets interested)

Implementation:
```html
<form action="/request-access" method="post">
  <input type="email" name="email" required placeholder="Your email">
  <input type="text" name="outlet" placeholder="Publication name">
  <button type="submit">Get Instant Access</button>
</form>
```

Backend:
- Send access link via email
- Add to CRM/media database
- Trigger follow-up sequence

**Strategy 4: NDA-Required**

Use For:
- Highly sensitive information (unreleased financials, M&A)
- Strategic partnerships (joint announcements)
- Legal/regulatory filings

Implementation:
- Digital signature (DocuSign, HelloSign)
- Manual review and approval
- Legal team involvement

Process:
1. Journalist requests access
2. Legal sends NDA
3. Journalist signs and returns
4. Access granted via unique link

**Strategy 5: IP Allowlist**

Use For:
- Partner portals (specific companies)
- Internal access (employee newsroom preview)

Implementation:
```javascript
const allowedIPs = ['203.0.113.0/24', '198.51.100.42'];

app.use((req, res, next) => {
  const clientIP = req.ip;
  if (isIPAllowed(clientIP, allowedIPs)) {
    next();
  } else {
    res.status(403).send('Access denied');
  }
});
```

Challenges:
- VPNs and proxies complicate IP detection
- Dynamic IPs require frequent updates
- Not suitable for individual journalists

**Strategy 6: OAuth/SSO Integration**

Use For:
- Partner portals (use company credentials)
- Media database integration (Cision, Muck Rack login)

Implementation:
- Google OAuth (authenticate with Google account)
- LinkedIn OAuth (verify journalist profile)
- SAML SSO (enterprise partners)

Advantages:
- No password management
- Verified identity
- Attribute sharing (name, email, organization)

#### Download Tracking and Analytics

**What to Track**:

Per Download:
- Asset ID and name
- User (if authenticated) or session ID (anonymous)
- Timestamp
- File format/size downloaded
- IP address and geolocation
- Referrer (how they found the asset)
- User agent (browser, device)

Aggregate Metrics:
- Total downloads per asset
- Downloads over time (trend analysis)
- Top assets by category
- Geographic distribution
- Media outlet identification (via email domain)

**Implementation**:

```javascript
// Log download event
async function logDownload(assetId, userId, metadata) {
  await db.downloads.insert({
    assetId,
    userId: userId || null,
    sessionId: metadata.sessionId,
    timestamp: new Date(),
    ipAddress: metadata.ip,
    country: metadata.geoip.country,
    userAgent: metadata.userAgent,
    referrer: metadata.referrer,
    format: metadata.format
  });

  // Update asset download count
  await db.assets.update(
    { id: assetId },
    { $inc: { downloadCount: 1 }}
  );
}
```

**Privacy Considerations**:

Compliance (GDPR, CCPA):
- Disclose tracking in privacy policy
- Anonymize IP addresses (truncate last octet)
- Data retention limits (delete logs after 12-24 months)
- Respect Do Not Track headers
- Provide opt-out mechanism

Best Practices:
- Don't track personally identifiable information unnecessarily
- Aggregate data (report trends, not individual users)
- Secure storage (encrypt sensitive fields)
- Access controls (limit who can view download data)

#### Journalist Relationship Management

**Purpose**: Build long-term relationships with media contacts who engage with your content.

**Data to Collect** (with consent):

- Contact information (name, email, phone)
- Outlet/publication
- Beat/coverage area
- Previous coverage of company
- Content interests (tags followed, downloads)
- Engagement history (email opens, link clicks)

**CRM Integration**:

Platforms:
- **Cision**: Media database + relationship management
- **Muck Rack**: Journalist profiles + monitoring
- **HubSpot**: General CRM with media contact segment
- **Custom**: Build on Salesforce, Airtable, etc.

Automated Workflows:
- First download: Add to "Engaged Journalists" list
- Multiple downloads: Flag as "Active Researcher" (potential story)
- Embargo access: Tag as "Tier 1 Media" (for future early access)
- No activity in 6 months: Re-engagement campaign

**Outreach Opportunities**:

- Personalized pitch (based on download history)
- Exclusive briefings (for highly engaged journalists)
- Content recommendations (suggest assets based on interests)
- Relationship building (not just transactional)

**Example Use Case**:

Journalist downloads:
1. CEO headshot
2. Company fact sheet
3. Recent press releases on AI products

Insight: Likely researching company for AI-focused article

Action: PR team reaches out with:
- Offer for CEO interview on AI strategy
- Exclusive access to AI research report (embargoed)
- Introduction to Chief AI Officer for technical deep-dive

## Conclusion

Modern media kit development in 2024-2025 requires a digital-first, self-service approach optimized for journalist efficiency and mobile access. Key success factors include:

1. **Zero-Friction Access**: Journalists should find and download assets in under 3 clicks with no registration barriers
2. **Comprehensive Asset Library**: High-quality visuals, video, and documents in multiple formats and resolutions
3. **Search and Discovery**: Robust search with filtering, categorization, and intelligent recommendations
4. **Mobile Optimization**: Responsive design with fast load times and touch-friendly interfaces
5. **Accessibility Compliance**: WCAG 2.1 AA standards as baseline for inclusive access
6. **Clear Licensing**: Transparent usage terms displayed before download
7. **Analytics and Insights**: Track engagement to optimize content and measure media relations effectiveness
8. **Regular Maintenance**: Quarterly updates to keep content fresh and accurate

The distinction between press kits (time-sensitive announcements), media kits (evergreen company resources), and brand kits (visual identity guidelines) should inform organizational structure and access controls.

Emerging trends include AI-powered search, video-first content strategies, real-time social media integration, and privacy-friendly analytics. Companies that balance cutting-edge technology with fundamental journalist needs will build stronger media relationships and earn more comprehensive coverage.
