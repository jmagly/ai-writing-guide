# Inception Phase Plan - AI Writing Guide (AIWG)

**Document Type**: Phase Management Plan
**Created**: 2025-10-17
**Author**: Project Manager
**Status**: ACTIVE
**Project**: AI Writing Guide - Contributor Workflow Feature
**Version**: 1.0
**Phase**: Inception (Weeks 1-4)
**Next Phase**: Elaboration (Planned Week 5)

## Executive Summary

**Phase Objective**: Document and baseline the AIWG SDLC framework plugin system architecture with complete SDLC artifacts, demonstrating self-application capability through comprehensive planning and multi-agent orchestration.

**Strategic Purpose**: This phase serves dual goals:
1. **Architecture Baseline**: Document the AIWG SDLC framework's plugin system for extensibility (platforms, compliance, verticals, workflows, standards)
2. **Credibility Demonstration**: Create visible reference implementation showing AIWG managing its own development using its own framework

**Timeline**: 4 weeks (October 17 - November 14, 2025)
**Team**: Solo developer (Joseph Magly) with multi-agent orchestration support
**Budget**: $0 (open source, volunteer effort)
**Risk Profile**: High (3 critical risks requiring active mitigation)

**Success Criteria Summary**:
- ✅ 100% SDLC artifact completeness (intake, architecture, testing, deployment docs)
- ✅ Full requirements traceability (requirements → architecture → enhancement plans)
- ✅ **Framework already operational** (multi-agent orchestration proven, self-application successful)
- ✅ Architecture baseline complete (SAD v1.0 + 6 ADRs)
- ✅ Enhancement plans documented (security 89h, testability 80h)
- ✅ Phase gate criteria met (Lifecycle Objective Milestone)

**Key Deliverables**:
1. ✅ Software Architecture Document (SAD) v1.0 with 6 ADRs - **COMPLETE (Oct 18)**
2. ✅ Security Enhancement Plan (4-week roadmap, 89 hours) - **COMPLETE (Oct 18)**
3. ✅ Testability Enhancement Plan (10-week roadmap, 80 hours) - **COMPLETE (Oct 18)**
4. ⏳ Test Strategy (testing the existing framework) - **Week 3**
5. ⏳ Deployment Plan (plugin deployment, framework updates) - **Week 4**
6. ⏳ Phase retrospective documenting learnings - **Week 4**

**Critical Path**: ✅ SAD/ADRs (COMPLETE) → Test Strategy (document existing framework testing) → Deployment Plan (plugin deployment process) → Retrospective

## 1. Phase Overview

### 1.1 Vision and Context

From Vision Document v1.0:

> **Strategic Direction:** The contributor workflow feature serves as both a critical capability AND the demonstration vehicle for AIWG's self-application maturity. By building this feature using our complete SDLC process - from intake through production deployment - we establish credible proof that AIWG can manage real-world development at scale.

**Why Inception Phase Matters**:
- **First Full SDLC Run**: This is AIWG's first feature developed with complete Inception → Elaboration → Construction → Transition artifacts
- **Reference Implementation**: `.aiwg/planning/contributor-workflow/` becomes the template for all future AIWG features
- **Market Validation**: Successful self-application proves framework works on real projects (not just theoretical)
- **Community Enablement**: Functional contributor workflow unlocks platform integrations (Cursor, Windsurf, Zed)

**What Makes This Phase Unique**:
- **Dogfooding Focus**: We're using AIWG to build AIWG (expect friction points, capture learnings)
- **Velocity Pressure**: Must prove full SDLC doesn't kill ship velocity (<2x baseline acceptable)
- **Transparency**: All artifacts visible publicly (credibility through openness)
- **Agent-Assisted**: Using AIWG's own agents to draft artifacts (efficiency validation)

### 1.2 Objectives

**Primary Objective**: **Demonstrate Self-Application Capability**

Generate complete SDLC artifacts for AIWG SDLC framework plugin system, proving AIWG can manage its own development with full traceability and quality.

**Success Metrics**:
- ✅ 100% artifact completeness (all required documents present and meet quality bar)
- ✅ 100% requirements traceability (intake → SAD → enhancement plans)
- ✅ All Inception phase gate criteria met (Lifecycle Objective Milestone)
- ✅ Artifacts score 80/100+ on AIWG's own quality gates (achieved 95/100 for SAD v1.0)

**Secondary Objective**: **Baseline Architecture for Plugin System**

Document the AIWG SDLC framework's plugin system architecture for general extensibility (platforms, compliance, verticals, workflows, standards).

**Success Metrics**:
- ✅ Software Architecture Document v1.0 BASELINED (95/100 quality, 12,847 words)
- ✅ 6 Architecture Decision Records formalized (all 85+/100 quality)
- ✅ Security enhancement plan (4-week roadmap, addresses 5 high-priority vulnerabilities)
- ✅ Testability enhancement plan (10-week roadmap, addresses 4 critical gaps)
- ✅ Multi-agent orchestration proven (4 parallel reviewers + synthesizer)

**Tertiary Objective**: **Prove Framework Already Operational**

Validate that the AIWG SDLC framework is already functional through self-application during Inception.

**Success Metrics**:
- ✅ Multi-agent workflows operational (SAD synthesis with 4 reviewers successful)
- ✅ Self-application demonstrated (using AIWG to document AIWG)
- ✅ Quality gates validated (markdown linting, manifest validation working)
- ✅ No critical bugs blocking framework usage (framework stable and working)

### 1.3 Scope

**Scope Clarification** (Oct 18 Update):

**What We're ACTUALLY Building**:
- AIWG SDLC framework plugin system architecture documentation
- NOT new contributor workflow commands (framework already exists and is operational)
- Enhancement plans for security and testability improvements (implementation in Construction)

**Evidence of Confusion in Early Planning**:
- Original plan referenced "contributor workflow commands" to implement
- Reality: The AIWG framework itself (commands, agents, flows) already exists and works
- This Inception phase is using the framework to document itself (self-application)
- The "functional prototype" is running right now (multi-agent orchestration operational)

**In Scope (Must-Have for Phase Gate)**:

**Requirements & Planning**:
- ✅ Project intake (COMPLETE - `.aiwg/intake/`)
- ✅ Vision document (COMPLETE - `.aiwg/working/vision/vision-v1.0-final.md`)
- ✅ Risk register (COMPLETE - `.aiwg/risks/risk-register.md`)
- ✅ Stakeholder register (COMPLETE - `.aiwg/requirements/stakeholder-register.md`)
- ✅ Software Architecture Document (SAD) v1.0 - **COMPLETE (Oct 18, 95/100 quality)**
- ✅ Architecture Decision Records (6 ADRs) - **COMPLETE (Oct 18, all 85+/100)**
- ✅ Inception phase plan (this document) - **COMPLETE (Oct 17)**

**Architecture Documentation** (replaces "Implementation"):
- ✅ Plugin system architecture (platforms, compliance, verticals, workflows, standards)
- ✅ 10 Mermaid.js diagrams (system, logical, deployment, security, component views)
- ✅ Security enhancement plan (4-week roadmap, 89 hours, addresses 5 vulnerabilities)
- ✅ Testability enhancement plan (10-week roadmap, 80 hours, addresses 4 gaps)
- ✅ Requirements traceability analysis (100% coverage achieved)

**Quality Assurance**:
- ✅ Quality gates validated (framework already operational):
  - ✅ Markdown linting (all rules passing)
  - ✅ Manifest sync validation (working)
  - ✅ Multi-agent orchestration (SAD v1.0 synthesis successful)
  - ✅ Self-application proven (using AIWG to document AIWG)
- ⏳ Test strategy document - **Week 3 deliverable** (testing the existing framework)
- ⏳ Framework validation results - **Week 3-4** (document current operational status)

**Deployment & Operations**:
- ⏳ Deployment plan - **Week 4 deliverable** (plugin deployment process, framework updates via `aiwg -update`)
- ⏳ Plugin installation procedures (documented in SAD, formalize deployment steps)
- ⏳ Rollback procedures (transaction-based rollback per ADR-006)

**Documentation**:
- ✅ Software Architecture Document v1.0 (BASELINED - `.aiwg/planning/sdlc-framework/architecture/`)
- ✅ 6 Architecture Decision Records (`.aiwg/architecture/decisions/`)
- ✅ Feature backlog (23 ideas for Elaboration - `.aiwg/requirements/backlog/feature-ideas.md`)
- ⏳ Command reference updates (if needed based on retrospective)
- ⏳ CHANGELOG entry (document Inception phase completion)

**Out of Scope (Deferred to Elaboration or Later)**:
- Advanced contributor features:
  - `aiwg -contribute-wizard` (interactive mode)
  - Multi-feature contribution management
  - Auto-rebase on conflicts
- Maintainer automation:
  - Auto-merge for trusted contributors
  - Batch PR operations
- Extended quality gates:
  - SAST/DAST security scanning
  - Performance regression testing
  - Cross-platform validation (macOS, Windows, Linux)
- Additional documentation:
  - Video tutorials
  - "Using AIWG for contributions" guide
  - PR guidelines and templates
- Multi-platform contributor workflow (Cursor, OpenAI, Windsurf) - **Claude Code only for Inception**

**Scope Management**:
- **Ruthless Prioritization**: If velocity exceeds 2x baseline, cut "nice-to-have" commands (status, monitor, respond)
- **MVP Focus**: Core workflow (start → test → pr) is non-negotiable; advanced features can defer
- **Time Boxing**: Artifact generation capped at 20% of development time; simplify if exceeded
- **Emergency Simplification**: If week 3 shows schedule risk, reduce test strategy to checklist (not formal document)

### 1.4 Success Criteria (Phase Gate)

**Lifecycle Objective (LO) Milestone Criteria**:

**Delivery Confidence**:
- **High Confidence (90%+)**: Inception plan, SAD/ADRs (using agent assistance), core commands (proven pattern from existing tools)
- **Medium Confidence (70-90%)**: Quality gates automation (new integration, testing required), test strategy (time boxing may simplify)
- **Lower Confidence (50-70%)**: Velocity target <2x (first full SDLC run, unknowns exist)

### 1.6 Constraints and Assumptions

**Constraints**:

**Resource Constraints**:
- **Solo Developer**: Joseph Magly is single contributor, 100% of development capacity
- **Time Availability**: Estimated 10-15 hours/week available for AIWG (not full-time)
- **Zero Budget**: No paid tools, infrastructure, or external resources
- **GitHub Free Tier**: 2000 CI/CD minutes/month limit (must stay within)

**Technical Constraints**:
- **Platform Dependency**: Claude Code API stability unknown (risk of breaking changes)
- **Existing Codebase**: Must maintain backward compatibility with existing AIWG commands
- **Manual Testing**: No automated E2E tests yet (manual dogfooding required for validation)
- **Single Platform**: Claude Code only (multi-platform deferred to validate demand first)

**Schedule Constraints**:
- **4-Week Timeline**: Fixed Inception duration (can extend 1-2 weeks max if critical gaps)
- **Phase 2 Dependency**: Early contributor testing planned Week 5-8 (requires functional workflow)
- **Holiday Buffer**: None in this period, but maintainer availability may vary week-to-week

**Assumptions**:

**Critical Assumptions (High Risk if Wrong)**:

**Assumption 1: Agent-Assisted Artifact Generation is Efficient**
- **Assumption**: Using AIWG agents (architecture-designer, technical-writer, etc.) to draft SAD, ADRs, test plans will reduce manual effort 50%+
- **Evidence**: Agents exist, tested for smaller documents, but not full SAD
- **Validation**: Measure time to draft SAD (target <2 days elapsed time)
- **Risk if Wrong**: Artifact generation takes >20% of development time, process overhead kills velocity
- **Mitigation**: Time box artifact drafting, simplify if agents inefficient, manual drafting fallback

**Assumption 2: Full SDLC Doesn't Kill Velocity**
- **Assumption**: Can deliver contributor workflow with complete artifacts in <14 days total (vs Warp's 7 days without artifacts)
- **Evidence**: Warp integration took ~7 days (no formal artifacts), 2x overhead acceptable for first full SDLC run
- **Validation**: Track time weekly, compare to baseline
- **Risk if Wrong**: Development stalls, maintainer burnout, credibility damage ("AIWG slows development")
- **Mitigation**: Ruthless scope management, cut optional features if velocity exceeds 2.5x baseline

**Assumption 3: Existing Documentation is Contributor-Ready**
- **Assumption**: Contributor quickstart (1,682 lines, 98/100 quality) and maintainer guide (1,816 lines, 96/100) are sufficient for early testing
- **Evidence**: Documents completed and scored highly on quality gates
- **Validation**: Maintainer dogfooding workflow using only documentation (no tribal knowledge)
- **Risk if Wrong**: Contributors confused, workflow fails <30 min test, Phase 2 delays
- **Mitigation**: Revise documentation based on dogfooding friction, 1-on-1 support for early testers

**Supporting Assumptions (Lower Risk)**:

**Assumption 4: Quality Gates Can Catch 90%+ Issues**
- **Assumption**: Automated lint, manifest sync, documentation checks will reduce maintainer manual review burden 50%+
- **Evidence**: Existing markdown linting, manifest tools functional
- **Validation**: Run quality gates on test PR, measure false positive/negative rates
- **Risk if Wrong**: Quality gates too strict (block valid PRs) or too loose (miss issues)
- **Mitigation**: Tune thresholds based on actual usage (start at 80/100, adjust)

**Assumption 5: Maintainer Can Sustain 10-15 Hours/Week**
- **Assumption**: Solo developer workload sustainable at 10-15 hours/week (2-3 hours/day weekdays)
- **Evidence**: Current velocity 35+ commits/month (roughly 10-12 hours/week estimated)
- **Validation**: Track time weekly, monitor burnout signals
- **Risk if Wrong**: Maintainer burnout, project delays or abandonment
- **Mitigation**: Ruthless prioritization, "maintenance only" periods if workload spikes, recruit 2nd maintainer by Month 6

**Assumption 6: No Major Platform API Changes During Inception**
- **Assumption**: Claude Code APIs stable during 4-week Inception phase
- **Evidence**: No indications of breaking changes, but platform still maturing
- **Validation**: Monitor Claude Code changelog, release notes weekly
- **Risk if Wrong**: Emergency fixes required, diverts from roadmap
- **Mitigation**: Use only documented APIs, abstraction layer for platform calls, rollback plan

**Assumption Validation Plan**:
- **Weekly Reviews**: Assess critical assumptions 1-3 in retrospectives
- **Metrics Dashboard**: Track velocity, artifact time, maintainer workload
- **Risk Escalation**: If any critical assumption invalidated, escalate to Project Owner for scope/timeline adjustment

- **Process Lead**: Retrospective facilitation support

**Future Team** (Planned Month 6+):
- 2nd Maintainer (promote successful contributor or recruit externally)
- Specialized roles (security lead, testing lead) as community grows

### 3.2 Time Allocation

**Joseph Magly (Solo Developer) - Estimated Hours per Week**:

| Week | Planning | Architecture | Implementation | Testing | Documentation | Retrospectives | Total Hours |
|------|----------|--------------|----------------|---------|---------------|----------------|-------------|
| Week 1 | 4 hours | 6 hours (SAD start) | 0 | 0 | 1 hour | 1 hour | 12 hours |
| Week 2 | 1 hour | 5 hours (ADRs, reviews) | 4 hours (start impl) | 0 | 1 hour | 1 hour | 12 hours |
| Week 3 | 1 hour | 1 hour | 7 hours (core impl) | 2 hours (dogfood) | 1 hour | 1 hour | 13 hours |
| Week 4 | 1 hour | 0 | 2 hours (polish) | 3 hours (validation) | 3 hours (docs) | 3 hours (retro, gate) | 12 hours |
| **Total** | **7 hours** | **12 hours** | **13 hours** | **5 hours** | **6 hours** | **6 hours** | **49 hours** |

**Average**: 12.25 hours/week (within sustainable 10-15 hour target)

**Breakdown by Activity Type**:
- **SDLC Artifacts** (Planning + Architecture + Retros): 25 hours (51% of total)
- **Implementation** (Code development): 13 hours (27% of total)
- **Validation** (Testing + Documentation): 11 hours (22% of total)

**Artifact Generation Time**: 25/49 = 51% (exceeds 20% target, but acceptable for first full SDLC run)

**Velocity Projection**:
- **Total Elapsed Time**: 4 weeks (28 days)
- **Active Development Days**: ~16 days (12 hours/week × 4 weeks ÷ 8 hours/day equivalent)
- **Baseline Comparison**: Warp integration ~7 days, contributor workflow ~16 days = 2.3x
- **Assessment**: Within acceptable <2.5x range for first full SDLC run

**Workload Risk Mitigation**:
- **Week 1-2**: Front-load architecture (SAD, ADRs) to unblock implementation
- **Week 3**: Peak implementation week (13 hours), monitor burnout signals
- **Week 4**: Lower workload (12 hours), focus on closure and retrospective
- **Flexibility**: If any week exceeds 15 hours, defer optional features (status, monitor commands)

### 3.3 Agent Utilization

**Agent Orchestration Pattern**: Primary Author → Parallel Reviewers → Synthesizer

**Estimated Agent Invocations**:

| Artifact | Primary Author | Reviewers (Parallel) | Synthesizer | Total Agent Calls |
|----------|----------------|----------------------|-------------|-------------------|
| SAD | architecture-designer (1) | security-architect, test-architect, requirements-analyst, technical-writer (4) | documentation-synthesizer (1) | 6 |
| ADRs (3-5) | architecture-designer (3-5) | technical-writer (1-2) | N/A | 4-7 |
| Test Strategy | test-architect (1) | quality-gatekeeper (1) | N/A | 2 |
| Deployment Plan | devops-engineer (1) | security-architect (1) | N/A | 2 |
| Phase Retrospective | process-lead (1) | N/A | N/A | 1 |
| Gate Review | quality-gatekeeper (1) | N/A | N/A | 1 |
| **Total** | **8-11** | **6-8** | **1** | **16-22** |

**Agent Efficiency Assumption**:
- Agents reduce manual drafting time 50%+ (e.g., SAD draft from 8 hours manual → 4 hours with agent)
- Multi-agent review reduces rework 30%+ (catch issues early, not after maintainer review)
- Synthesis reduces final editing 40%+ (merge feedback automatically, not manual reconciliation)

**Agent Validation** (Week 1-2 focus):
- Track time to draft SAD with architecture-designer vs estimated manual time
- Measure review cycle efficiency (parallel vs sequential)
- Assess synthesis quality (manual editing required after synthesis?)

### 3.4 Tool Requirements

**Existing Tools (Already Available)**:
- **Development**: Git, Node.js, bash, GitHub CLI (`gh`)
- **Markdown Linting**: markdownlint-cli2, custom fixers (`tools/lint/`)
- **Manifest Management**: Custom manifest tools (`tools/manifest/`)
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions (2000 minutes/month free tier)
- **Agent Framework**: AIWG's own multi-agent orchestration (58 agents, 42+ commands)

**New Tools Required**:
- **Contributor Workspace**: `.aiwg/contrib/{feature}/` directory structure (create during implementation)
- **Quality Gate Orchestrator**: Script to run lint + manifest + docs checks (Week 3 deliverable)
- **PR Templates**: GitHub PR template for contributor workflow (add to `.github/`)
- **Stats Dashboard**: Simple metrics script for `aiwg -review-stats` (Week 3 deliverable)

**Infrastructure Requirements**:
- **Storage**: Minimal (SDLC artifacts <10 MB total)
- **CI/CD Minutes**: Estimated 100-200 minutes/month for quality gate checks (well within 2000 limit)
- **External Services**: GitHub API (free tier), no additional services needed

**Cost**: $0 (all free tier or open source tools)

### 4.4 Review and Approval Process

**Artifact Review Process**:

**1. Primary Authoring** (Agent-Assisted):
- Agent drafts initial version (e.g., architecture-designer for SAD)
- Maintainer reviews draft, provides high-level feedback
- Agent revises based on feedback
- Output: v0.1 draft ready for multi-agent review

**2. Multi-Agent Review** (Parallel):
- Launch 3-5 reviewer agents in single message (parallel execution)
- Each agent reviews from their perspective (security, testing, requirements, clarity)
- Reviews collected in `.aiwg/planning/contributor-workflow/{artifact}/reviews/`
- Timeline: 1-2 days for review cycle

**3. Synthesis** (Agent or Manual):
- Documentation synthesizer merges feedback (if conflicts, manual resolution)
- Final artifact incorporates all accepted feedback
- Maintainer approves final version
- Output: BASELINED artifact

**4. Publication**:
- Artifact committed to `.aiwg/planning/contributor-workflow/{category}/`
- Linked from Inception plan, traceability matrix, etc.
- Marked BASELINED (immutable unless change control process)

**Code Review Process**:

**1. Self-Review**:
- Maintainer tests all commands manually (dogfooding)
- Runs quality gates (lint, manifest, docs checks)
- Fixes obvious bugs, improves error messages

**2. Quality Gate Validation**:
- Automated gates run on CI/CD (if PR created)
- Manual quality checks (maintainer self-assessment)

**3. Approval**:
- Maintainer approves (solo developer, self-approval acceptable for Inception)
- Phase 2+ will have external contributor PRs requiring maintainer review

**Gate Review Process**:

**1. Self-Assessment** (Week 4):
- Quality gatekeeper agent assesses all gate criteria (Section 4.2)
- Produces gate review report with scores and recommendations

**2. Maintainer Decision**:
- Joseph Magly reviews gate report
- Makes PASS/CONDITIONAL/EXTEND/ABORT decision
- Documents rationale and next steps

**3. Stakeholder Communication**:
- If PASS or CONDITIONAL: Announce Elaboration phase kickoff
- If EXTEND: Communicate timeline adjustment, remediation plan
- If ABORT: Transparent retrospective on why, next steps

**Approval Authority**:
- **Solo Developer Phase**: Joseph Magly has final approval on all artifacts, code, decisions
- **Future Team Phase**: Shared approval (consensus for major decisions, domain ownership for specialized areas)

---

## 5. Risk Management

### 5.1 Critical Risks (Top 3)

**Risk 1: R-PROC-01 - Process Overhead Kills Velocity (CRITICAL)**

**Risk Score**: 9/9 (Probability: High, Impact: High)

**Description**: Full SDLC artifacts (SAD, ADRs, test plans, deployment docs) slow development to 2x+ previous feature velocity. This is the HIGHEST CREDIBILITY RISK - if AIWG can't ship fast using AIWG, nobody will believe it works.

**Inception Phase Mitigation**:
- **Week 1**: Establish velocity baseline (measure Warp integration retrospectively: ~7 days)
- **Week 2**: Use architecture-designer agent to draft SAD (target <2 days vs 4-8 days manual)
- **Week 3**: Parallel workstreams (implement commands while finalizing artifacts, not sequential)
- **Week 4**: Time box retrospective and gate review (max 3 hours combined, not multi-day analysis)

**Monitoring**:
- **Daily**: Track hours spent on artifacts vs implementation (target <20% on artifacts)
- **Weekly**: Retrospective velocity check (elapsed days vs 14-day target)
- **Signals**: If Week 2 shows >50% time on artifacts, simplify test strategy to checklist

**Contingency**:
- If velocity >2.5x baseline by Week 3:
  - Cut optional commands (status, monitor, respond)
  - Simplify test strategy to checklist (not formal document)
  - Defer deployment plan polish (basic checklist sufficient)
  - Transparent communication: "First full SDLC run, learnings captured for process optimization"

**Owner**: Process Lead (Joseph Magly)

**Status**: ACTIVE - Velocity tracked weekly, agents used for artifact drafting

---

**Risk 2: R-RES-01 - Solo Maintainer Burnout (CRITICAL)**

**Risk Score**: 9/9 (Probability: High, Impact: High)

**Description**: Joseph Magly overwhelmed by development + artifact generation + risk management. Burnout leads to quality degradation, delays, or project abandonment.

**Inception Phase Mitigation**:
- **Week 1**: Quality gates automation prioritized (markdown lint, manifest sync integrated into CI/CD)
- **Week 2**: Agent-assisted artifact generation (reduce manual effort 50%+)
- **Week 3**: Dogfooding focus (validate workflow UX before external testing, reduce Phase 2 support burden)
- **Week 4**: "Maintenance only" buffer (if Week 3 exceeds 15 hours, scale back Week 4 scope)

**Monitoring**:
- **Weekly**: Track total hours on AIWG (target <15 hours/week, max 18 hours)
- **Daily**: Monitor morale, energy levels (self-assessment)
- **Signals**: If 2 consecutive weeks >15 hours, activate contingency

**Contingency**:
- If burnout signals detected (workload spike, quality issues, missed deadlines):
  - Extend Inception by 1 week (5-week total)
  - Defer optional features (status, monitor commands)
  - Simplify remaining artifacts (checklists vs formal documents)
  - Transparent communication: "Pacing for sustainability, quality over speed"

**Owner**: Project Owner (Joseph Magly - self-monitoring)

**Status**: ACTIVE - Time tracking started, weekly workload reviews

---

**Risk 3: R-CRED-01 - Self-Application Reveals Framework Flaws (CRITICAL)**

**Risk Score**: 6/9 (Probability: Medium, Impact: High)

**Description**: Dogfooding exposes gaps, inefficiencies, or broken workflows in AIWG. Public artifacts reveal framework immaturity, damaging credibility.

**Inception Phase Mitigation**:
- **Week 1-4**: Embrace "learning in public" philosophy (transparent about friction points)
- **Week 2**: Friction log started (capture dogfooding issues as discovered, not hidden)
- **Week 3**: Dogfooding session dedicated to UX validation (use only documentation, no shortcuts)
- **Week 4**: Comprehensive retrospective published (honest assessment of what worked/didn't)

**Monitoring**:
- **Continuous**: Friction log updated as issues discovered
- **Weekly**: Retrospective reviews friction points, identifies quick fixes
- **Milestone**: Phase retrospective categorizes issues (framework flaws vs user error vs documentation gaps)

**Contingency**:
- If major framework flaws discovered (e.g., agent orchestration broken, quality gates unusable):
  - Fix immediately (prioritize over new features)
  - Document transparently ("Issue discovered during dogfooding, fixed in [PR]")
  - Delay Phase 2 external testing until flaws resolved
  - Publish honest retrospective: "What we learned improving AIWG by using AIWG"

**Owner**: Vision Owner (Joseph Magly)

**Status**: ACTIVE - Friction log initialized, transparent communication planned

---

### 5.2 Active Risk Monitoring

**Weekly Risk Review Cadence**:

**Week 1 Focus**:
- R-PROC-01: Velocity baseline established, artifact time tracking started
- R-RES-01: Workload monitoring, quality gate automation scoped
- R-CRED-01: Friction log initialized, retrospective format defined

**Week 2 Focus**:
- R-PROC-01: SAD drafting efficiency measured (agent vs manual time)
- R-TECH-01: Platform API dependencies documented
- R-CRED-02: SAD quality self-assessment (meets 80/100 bar?)

**Week 3 Focus**:
- R-PROC-02: Dogfooding UX validation (workflow complexity assessment)
- R-TECH-02: Quality gate false positive/negative rates measured
- R-TECH-03: Integration test gaps identified, documented

**Week 4 Focus**:
- R-PROC-01: Final velocity assessment (< or >2x baseline?)
- R-RES-01: Burnout check (sustainable workload achieved?)
- R-CRED-01: Retrospective captures all friction points, improvements identified

**Risk Dashboard** (Weekly Snapshot):

| Risk ID | Week 1 Status | Week 2 Status | Week 3 Status | Week 4 Status | Trend |
|---------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|-------|
| R-PROC-01 | ACTIVE (monitoring) | ACTIVE (SAD draft test) | ACTIVE (velocity check) | MITIGATED (final assessment) | ↓ |
| R-RES-01 | ACTIVE (time tracking) | ACTIVE (workload OK) | ACTIVE (peak week watch) | MITIGATED (sustainable) | ↓ |
| R-CRED-01 | ACTIVE (friction log started) | ACTIVE (dogfooding issues) | ACTIVE (UX validation) | MITIGATED (retro published) | ↓ |
| R-TECH-01 | ACTIVE (monitoring APIs) | ACTIVE (dependencies documented) | ACTIVE (no breakage) | MITIGATED (stable) | → |
| R-TECH-02 | PLANNED | PLANNED | ACTIVE (tuning gates) | MITIGATED (thresholds set) | ↓ |
| R-TECH-03 | PLANNED | PLANNED | ACTIVE (gaps documented) | ACCEPTED (defer E2E) | → |
| R-CRED-02 | PLANNED | ACTIVE (SAD quality check) | ACTIVE (artifacts review) | MITIGATED (quality met) | ↓ |

**Legend**:
- ↓ = Risk decreasing (mitigations working)
- → = Risk stable (monitoring continues)
- ↑ = Risk increasing (escalate, activate contingency)

### 5.3 Escalation Criteria

**Immediate Escalation to Project Owner (Self-Escalation for Solo Developer)**:

**Critical Triggers**:
1. **Velocity Risk**: Week 3 shows >2.5x baseline elapsed time (>17 days projected)
2. **Burnout Risk**: Any week exceeds 18 hours, or 2 consecutive weeks >15 hours
3. **Critical Bug**: Show-stopper bug discovered that blocks core workflow (start → test → pr)
4. **Platform API Breakage**: Claude Code API changes break AIWG during Inception
5. **Artifact Quality Crisis**: SAD or ADRs fail to meet 80/100 quality bar after 2 revisions

**Escalation Actions**:
- **Velocity**: Activate scope reduction (cut optional commands, simplify artifacts)
- **Burnout**: Add 1 week to Inception (5-week total), reduce scope
- **Critical Bug**: Defer other work, fix immediately, delay phase gate if needed
- **API Breakage**: Emergency vendor communication, rollback plan, delay deployment
- **Quality Crisis**: Manual drafting fallback (agents insufficient), extend timeline

**Communication**:
- **Internal**: Decision log updated with escalation rationale and action plan
- **External**: Transparent GitHub Discussion if timeline or scope changes affect Phase 2 testers

### 5.4 Risk Acceptance

**Risks Accepted for Inception Phase** (Defer Mitigation to Elaboration):

**R-TECH-04: Performance Degradation at Scale** (Risk Score: 2/9)
- **Rationale**: Unlikely to hit performance limits with <50 SDLC artifacts during Inception
- **Deferral**: Monitor, but no active optimization unless issues emerge
- **Elaboration Action**: Scalability testing if Phase 3 grows artifact volume

**R-PROC-05: Adoption Barrier for Non-Git Users** (Risk Score: 1/9)
- **Rationale**: Primary contributors are developers (platform integrations require code)
- **Deferral**: GitHub web UI documented as workaround, no custom tooling yet
- **Elaboration Action**: If documentation contributors struggle, add simplified workflow

**R-EXT-02: Agentic Development Fad Fades** (Risk Score: 3/9)
- **Rationale**: Long-term market risk (2-5 year horizon), no short-term mitigation available
- **Deferral**: Accept, position AIWG as general SDLC framework (not agentic-only)
- **Elaboration Action**: Quarterly market monitoring, positioning adjustments if needed

**R-CRED-05: No Visible Community Contributions** (Risk Score: 2/9)
- **Rationale**: Inception phase is internal dogfooding, external contributions not expected until Phase 2
- **Deferral**: Phase 2 validation will test community interest
- **Elaboration Action**: If Phase 2 testing fails, pivot contributor workflow strategy

**Risk Acceptance Documentation**:
- All accepted risks remain in risk register with "ACTIVE (Monitoring)" status
- Quarterly reviews assess if acceptance still appropriate
- Escalate if accepted risk probability or impact increases

- Decision: Extend Inception to 5 weeks (if gate criteria not met)

**Timing**: As decisions arise (not scheduled)

---

### 6.2 External Communication (Community, Stakeholders)

**No External Communication During Inception** (Internal Phase):

**Rationale**:
- Inception is internal dogfooding and planning
- No external contributors involved until Phase 2 (early tester cohort)
- Premature communication creates expectations, pressure

**Exception - If Critical Issues**:
- Platform API breakage affecting existing AIWG users → GitHub Discussion notification
- Major timeline changes delaying Phase 2 testing → Update README with revised schedule

---

**Post-Inception Communication** (After Gate Review):

**If Gate Decision: PASS or CONDITIONAL PASS**:

**GitHub Discussion Post** (Week 5):
- **Title**: "Inception Phase Complete: Contributor Workflow Moving to Elaboration"
- **Content**:
  - Inception phase achievements (SAD, ADRs, core commands functional)
  - Phase retrospective highlights (learnings, improvements)
  - Link to SDLC artifacts (`.aiwg/planning/contributor-workflow/`)
  - Elaboration phase preview (early tester recruitment, refinement)
  - Call to action: "Interested in testing? Watch for Phase 2 recruitment"
- **Audience**: Existing AIWG users, prospective contributors

**README Update**:
- Add "Self-Application in Progress" section
- Link to contributor workflow artifacts
- Note: "AIWG dogfooding its own SDLC - see `.aiwg/planning/contributor-workflow/` for reference"

**If Gate Decision: EXTEND INCEPTION**:

**GitHub Discussion Post**:
- **Title**: "Inception Phase Extended: Timeline and Scope Update"
- **Content**:
  - Honest explanation of why extension needed (gaps, complexity, learnings)
  - Revised timeline (5-6 week Inception)
  - What will improve during extension (specific artifacts or features)
  - Reaffirm commitment to quality over speed
- **Audience**: Stakeholders expecting Phase 2 testing

**If Gate Decision: ABORT/PIVOT**:

**GitHub Discussion Post**:
- **Title**: "Contributor Workflow Pivot: Learnings from Inception"
- **Content**:
  - Transparent explanation of why pivot needed (show-stopper issues, velocity unacceptable)
  - Learnings captured (framework gaps, process flaws)
  - Alternative approach (simplified workflow, different feature prioritization)
  - Retrospective link (full transparency)
- **Audience**: All stakeholders (credibility through honesty)

---

### 6.3 Stakeholder-Specific Messaging

**Joseph Magly (Maintainer - Self-Communication)**:

**Weekly Self-Check**:
- Am I on track for <15 hours/week average?
- Are artifacts meeting quality standards?
- Am I cutting corners due to time pressure?
- Do I feel sustainable or burning out?

**Decision Prompts**:
- If >15 hours any week: What can I defer or simplify?
- If artifacts <80/100 quality: Do I need more agent assistance or time?
- If velocity >2.5x baseline: What scope can I cut without compromising core value?

---

**Early Contributor Testers (Phase 2 Preview)**:

**No Communication During Inception** (They're not engaged yet)

**Post-Inception (If PASS)**:
- Recruitment email (template in stakeholder register)
- "Contributor workflow ready for testing, need 2-5 volunteers"
- Quickstart guide link, time commitment (30 min), incentives (recognition, influence)

---

**Platform Vendors (Anthropic, OpenAI)**:

**No Communication During Inception** (Too early, no critical mass yet)

**Post-Phase 3** (Earliest Month 4):
- Only if AIWG gains traction (50+ users, 10+ platform integrations)
- Quarterly update email (template in stakeholder register)
- Highlight API usage, feedback, community growth

---

**Prospective AIWG Users**:

**Passive Communication** (Documentation):
- README updated after Inception (self-application artifacts visible)
- No active outreach (let artifacts speak for themselves)

---

## 7. Iteration Management

### 7.1 Progress Tracking

**Daily Progress** (Informal):
- Solo developer self-tracking via task checklist (Section 2 week plans)
- Git commits document implementation progress
- Friction log captures issues as discovered

**Weekly Progress** (Formal):
- Friday retrospective assesses week's deliverables vs plan
- Update Section 1.5 deliverable table with status (COMPLETE, IN PROGRESS, BLOCKED, DEFERRED)
- Velocity metrics updated (hours spent, elapsed days)

**Phase Progress** (Milestone):
- Week 4 gate review assesses all success criteria (Section 1.4)
- Final phase retrospective (Section 6.1)

**Progress Visualization** (Manual Dashboard):

| Week | Planned Deliverables | Completed | In Progress | Deferred | % Complete | Hours Spent | Velocity |
|------|----------------------|-----------|-------------|----------|------------|-------------|----------|
| 1 | 5 | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| 2 | 5 | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| 3 | 7 | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| 4 | 8 | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD |

**Velocity Calculation**:
- **Baseline**: Warp integration ~7 days (reference point)
- **Current**: Elapsed days from Oct 17 to current date
- **Projected**: Current velocity extrapolated to 100% completion
- **Target**: <14 days total (2x baseline acceptable), <21 days max (3x abort threshold)

### 7.2 Issue Management

**Issue Tracking** (GitHub Issues):

**Inception Phase Issues**:
- Tag with `phase:inception` label
- Prioritize P0 (blocking), P1 (high), P2 (medium), P3 (low)
- Track in `.aiwg/planning/contributor-workflow/issues/` (if external GitHub Issues not used)

**Issue Categories**:
- **Blocker**: Prevents core workflow or artifact completion (immediate fix required)
- **Bug**: Functional issue but workarounds exist (fix within week)
- **Enhancement**: Nice-to-have improvement (defer to Elaboration unless trivial)
- **Documentation**: Doc gaps or inaccuracies (fix during Week 4 doc updates)

**Issue Resolution SLA**:
- **Blocker**: Same day resolution (or escalate, activate contingency)
- **Bug**: Within 1 week (or defer to Elaboration if low priority)
- **Enhancement**: Backlog for Elaboration (unless quick win <1 hour)
- **Documentation**: Fixed during Week 4 documentation sprint

**Known Issues Documentation**:
- Maintain `known-issues.md` in artifact directory
- Transparent about limitations (e.g., "No automated E2E tests yet, manual dogfooding only")
- Link to Elaboration backlog for deferred fixes

### 7.3 Change Control

**Scope Changes**:

**Minor Changes** (No Plan Update Required):
- Bug fixes, documentation clarifications, small refactorings
- Maintainer decision, document in commit message

**Major Changes** (Requires Plan Update):
- Scope reduction (cutting commands, simplifying artifacts)
- Timeline extension (5-6 week Inception)
- Architecture pivots (major design changes)

**Change Control Process**:
1. **Identify Change Need**: Retrospective, risk escalation, or dogfooding friction
2. **Assess Impact**: Affects velocity? Quality? Gate criteria?
3. **Decision**: Maintainer approves/rejects (solo developer = self-approval)
4. **Document**: Update Inception plan (Section 1.3 Scope, Section 2 week plans)
5. **Communicate**: Decision log entry, stakeholder notification if external impact

**Examples**:
- **Scope Reduction**: Cut `aiwg -contribute-status` to meet velocity target
  - Impact: Medium (nice-to-have, not core workflow)
  - Decision: APPROVED (defer to Elaboration)
  - Document: Update Section 1.3 Out of Scope, decision log entry
- **Timeline Extension**: Add 1 week to Inception (5-week total)
  - Impact: High (delays Phase 2 testing)
  - Decision: APPROVED (quality over speed)
  - Document: Update all week dates, communicate in GitHub Discussion

**Change Log** (Tracked in Inception Plan):
- Maintain revision history at end of document
- Note: What changed, why, when, who decided

---

## 8. Dependencies and Assumptions

### 8.1 External Dependencies

**Platform Dependencies**:

**Claude Code (Anthropic)**:
- **Dependency**: AIWG contributor workflow uses Claude Code agent deployment infrastructure
- **Risk**: API breaking changes during Inception (R-TECH-01)
- **Mitigation**: Use only documented APIs, monitor changelog weekly, abstraction layer for platform calls
- **Contingency**: Emergency fixes if API breakage, delay deployment if critical

**GitHub**:
- **Dependency**: PR creation, GitHub CLI (`gh`), Actions (CI/CD)
- **Risk**: GitHub service outage, API rate limits
- **Mitigation**: Free tier sufficient (2000 CI minutes/month), rate limits unlikely for solo developer
- **Contingency**: Manual PR creation fallback if CLI issues, delay CI/CD checks if outage

**Node.js Ecosystem**:
- **Dependency**: markdownlint-cli2, js-yaml, other npm packages
- **Risk**: Dependency vulnerabilities, breaking updates (R-TECH-05)
- **Mitigation**: Lock versions in package.json, Dependabot monitoring, minimal dependencies
- **Contingency**: Rapid CVE patching (<7 days for critical), dependency rollback if breaking update

**No External Service Dependencies**:
- No paid SaaS, APIs, or infrastructure required
- Reduces risk of external service failures

### 8.2 Internal Dependencies

**Intake Artifacts** (Already Complete):
- Software Architecture Document (SAD) depends on intake requirements
- Traceability matrix depends on intake completeness
- Status: COMPLETE, no blocking dependency

**Agent Framework** (Already Available):
- Artifact drafting depends on AIWG's own agents (architecture-designer, test-architect, etc.)
- Multi-agent orchestration depends on Task tool functionality
- Status: AVAILABLE, agents tested on smaller documents (scaling to SAD is validation)

**Existing Tools** (Already Functional):
- Quality gates depend on markdown linting tools (`tools/lint/`)
- Manifest validation depends on manifest management tools (`tools/manifest/`)
- Status: FUNCTIONAL, existing tools proven on AIWG codebase

**Documentation** (Already Complete):
- Contributor workflow depends on contributor quickstart guide (1,682 lines, 98/100 quality)
- Maintainer review depends on maintainer review guide (1,816 lines, 96/100 quality)
- Status: COMPLETE, high quality, ready for dogfooding validation

**No Blocking Internal Dependencies**:
- All prerequisite artifacts and tools complete before Inception kickoff
- Parallel workstreams possible (architecture + implementation can overlap)

### 8.3 Critical Assumptions (Detailed)

**Assumption 1: Agent-Assisted Artifact Generation is Efficient**

**Assumption Statement**: Using AIWG agents to draft SAD, ADRs, test strategy will reduce manual effort by 50%+ compared to manual writing.

**Evidence Supporting**:
- Agents successfully used for smaller documents (vision document synthesized with multi-agent review)
- Architecture-designer agent tested on ADR drafts (not full SAD yet)
- Maintainer's 30 years engineering background enables effective agent prompting

**Evidence Against**:
- Full SAD drafting untested (largest artifact yet)
- Agent output quality variable (may require significant editing)
- Multi-agent review coordination adds overhead (if poorly executed)

**Validation Plan**:
- **Week 1-2**: Measure time to draft SAD with architecture-designer vs estimated manual time (8 hours manual → target 4 hours with agent)
- **Metric**: Artifact generation time <20% of total development time
- **Success Criteria**: SAD draft in <2 days elapsed time, <4 hours maintainer effort

**Impact if Wrong**:
- Artifact generation consumes >20% of time, slows velocity
- Manual drafting fallback required (slower, more maintainer burden)
- Process overhead kills velocity (R-PROC-01 realized)

**Mitigation if Invalidated**:
- Simplify remaining artifacts (test strategy → checklist, deployment plan → basic steps)
- Manual drafting for critical artifacts (SAD must complete, agents optional)
- Capture learnings: Document agent inefficiencies, improve prompts for Elaboration

---

**Assumption 2: Full SDLC Doesn't Kill Velocity**

**Assumption Statement**: Can deliver contributor workflow with complete SDLC artifacts in <14 days total (vs Warp's 7 days without artifacts), demonstrating 2x overhead acceptable for first full run.

**Evidence Supporting**:
- Agent-assisted artifacts should reduce manual effort 50%+
- Parallel workstreams (architecture + implementation) reduce sequential delay
- Solo developer experienced (30 years), efficient coder

**Evidence Against**:
- First full SDLC run (unknowns exist, process friction expected)
- Multiple artifacts required (SAD, ADRs, test strategy, deployment plan, retrospectives)
- Quality bar high (80/100+), may require multiple revision cycles

**Validation Plan**:
- **Weekly**: Track elapsed days and hours spent (dashboard in Section 7.1)
- **Milestone**: Week 3 velocity check (if >17 days projected, activate contingency)
- **Final**: Week 4 retrospective assesses final velocity (< or >2x baseline?)

**Impact if Wrong**:
- Development stalls, maintainer burnout (R-RES-01)
- Credibility damage: "AIWG slows development, not enhances it"
- Community skepticism: "Framework is bureaucratic overhead"

**Mitigation if Invalidated**:
- **2.5x velocity** (17-21 days): Simplify remaining artifacts, cut optional features (status, monitor)
- **3x velocity** (21+ days): Abort, pivot to minimal SDLC (intake + ADRs only), retrospective on why
- Transparent communication: "First full SDLC run, process optimization learnings captured"

---

**Assumption 3: Existing Documentation is Contributor-Ready**

**Assumption Statement**: Contributor quickstart (1,682 lines, 98/100) and maintainer guide (1,816 lines, 96/100) are sufficient for early testing, no major revisions needed during Inception.

**Evidence Supporting**:
- Both documents scored 95-98/100 on AIWG quality gates (high quality)
- Comprehensive coverage (forking, workspace setup, commands, quality gates, PR creation)
- Reviewed by multi-agent panel (technical writer, UX lead)

**Evidence Against**:
- Not validated with real users yet (maintainer-written, not user-tested)
- Dogfooding may reveal gaps (steps unclear, assumptions wrong)
- Contributors vary in experience (git novices vs power users)

**Validation Plan**:
- **Week 3**: Maintainer dogfooding using ONLY documentation (no tribal knowledge shortcuts)
- **Metric**: Can complete workflow in <30 minutes using only docs?
- **Success Criteria**: No critical gaps blocking workflow, minor revisions acceptable

**Impact if Wrong**:
- Contributors confused, workflow fails <30 min test
- Phase 2 delays (documentation revisions required before testing)
- Maintainer support burden increases (answering preventable questions)

**Mitigation if Invalidated**:
- **Week 3-4**: Revise documentation based on dogfooding friction points
- **Phase 2**: White-glove support for early testers (1-on-1 help, not scalable but validates fixes)
- **Elaboration**: Major documentation overhaul if needed (video tutorials, simplified guides)

---

**Assumption 4: Maintainer Can Sustain 10-15 Hours/Week**

**Assumption Statement**: Joseph Magly can sustainably commit 10-15 hours/week for 4 weeks (49 hours total projected) without burnout or quality degradation.

**Evidence Supporting**:
- Current velocity: 35+ commits/month (~10-12 hours/week estimated)
- Solo developer accustomed to AIWG workload
- 30 years engineering background (efficient, experienced)

**Evidence Against**:
- Adding SDLC artifacts increases workload vs previous features
- Peak weeks (Week 3: 13 hours) may exceed comfortable pace
- No backup if maintainer unavailable (vacation, illness, other priorities)

**Validation Plan**:
- **Weekly**: Track actual hours spent vs projected (Section 3.2 table)
- **Daily**: Self-assessment of morale, energy, quality
- **Signal**: If 2 consecutive weeks >15 hours, activate contingency

**Impact if Wrong**:
- Maintainer burnout (R-RES-01 realized)
- Quality degradation (rushed artifacts, bugs, missed issues)
- Project delays or abandonment (worst case)

**Mitigation if Invalidated**:
- **Immediate**: Extend Inception by 1 week (5-week total), reduce scope
- **Short-term**: "Maintenance only" periods (no new features, just stability)
- **Long-term**: Recruit 2nd maintainer by Month 6 (accelerate if burnout signals)

---

**Assumption 5: No Major Platform API Changes During Inception**

**Assumption Statement**: Claude Code APIs remain stable during 4-week Inception phase, no breaking changes requiring emergency fixes.

**Evidence Supporting**:
- No indications of imminent breaking changes (changelog monitoring)
- Anthropic incentivized to maintain API stability (ecosystem growth)
- AIWG uses only documented APIs (not undocumented hacks)

**Evidence Against**:
- Claude Code still maturing (platform stability unknown)
- AI platforms evolve rapidly (breaking changes common in industry)
- Historical precedent: Unexpected API deprecations happen

**Validation Plan**:
- **Weekly**: Monitor Claude Code changelog, release notes, developer forums
- **Proactive**: Document platform API dependencies (Week 2 deliverable)
- **Reactive**: Emergency fix workflow if breakage detected

**Impact if Wrong**:
- Emergency fixes required (diverts from roadmap, delays Inception)
- User impact if existing AIWG installations break
- Negative perception: "AIWG unreliable, platform dependency risk"

**Mitigation if Invalidated**:
- **Immediate**: Emergency hotfix (<24 hour turnaround), notify users via GitHub Discussion
- **Short-term**: Delay Inception phase gate if critical fixes needed (extend 1 week)
- **Long-term**: Strengthen abstraction layer, reduce platform coupling, consider multi-platform hedge
