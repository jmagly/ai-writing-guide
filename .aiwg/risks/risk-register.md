**Document Type**: Risk Management Artifact
**Created**: 2025-10-17
**Author**: Risk Manager
**Status**: ACTIVE
**Project**: AI Writing Guide - Contributor Workflow Feature (Phase 1)
**Version**: 1.0
**Review Cycle**: Weekly during Inception, Bi-weekly during Elaboration+

## Executive Summary

**Total Identified Risks**: 24 across 5 categories
**Critical Risks (High Impact + High Probability)**: 3
**High Priority Risks**: 8
**Medium Priority Risks**: 9
**Low Priority Risks**: 4

**Top 3 Critical Risks**:
1. **R-PROC-01**: Process Overhead Kills Velocity (Impact: High, Probability: High, Score: 9)
2. **R-RES-01**: Solo Maintainer Burnout (Impact: High, Probability: High, Score: 9)
3. **R-CRED-01**: Self-Application Reveals Framework Flaws (Impact: High, Probability: Medium, Score: 6)

**Risk Exposure**: High during Inception phase (weeks 1-4) due to first full SDLC self-application attempt. Expected to decrease as dogfooding validates approach and automation reduces maintainer burden.

**Mitigation Focus Phase 1**: Automate quality gates (90%+ validation coverage), measure velocity continuously, transparent communication about learnings (embrace imperfection), recruit 2nd maintainer by Month 6.

## Risk Categories

This risk register organizes risks into five categories aligned with the contributor workflow demonstration:

1. **Technical (TECH)**: Architecture, integration, performance, quality issues
2. **Process (PROC)**: SDLC overhead, adoption barriers, workflow complexity
3. **Resource (RES)**: Maintainer capacity, funding, team growth
4. **External (EXT)**: Platform changes, competition, market shifts
5. **Credibility (CRED)**: Self-application failure, perception, trust

## Risk Scoring Methodology

**Probability Scale**:
- **High (3)**: >50% likelihood within project timeline
- **Medium (2)**: 20-50% likelihood within project timeline
- **Low (1)**: <20% likelihood within project timeline

**Impact Scale**:
- **High (3)**: Project failure, significant rework, credibility damage
- **Medium (2)**: Schedule delays, scope reduction, quality degradation
- **Low (1)**: Minor inconvenience, easy workarounds, negligible impact

**Risk Score**: Probability × Impact (1-9 scale)
- **7-9**: Critical (immediate action required)
- **4-6**: High (active mitigation required)
- **2-3**: Medium (monitor and prepare contingencies)
- **1**: Low (accept and document)

## Risk Status Definitions

- **ACTIVE**: Risk identified, mitigation in progress, requires monitoring
- **MITIGATED**: Mitigation actions completed, residual risk low, monitoring continues
- **REALIZED**: Risk event occurred, executing contingency plan
- **CLOSED**: Risk no longer applicable (conditions changed, project phase completed)

## TECHNICAL RISKS

### R-TECH-01: Platform API Breaking Changes

**Category**: Technical - External Dependencies
**ID**: R-TECH-01

**Description**: Anthropic (Claude Code) or other platform vendors change APIs without notice, breaking AIWG commands, agent deployments, or core functionality. This could happen through deprecations, security changes, or platform redesigns.

**Probability**: Medium (2)
- Platform vendors iterate rapidly
- Claude Code still maturing (API stability unknown)
- Historical precedent: AI platforms change frequently

**Impact**: High (3)
- User churn if AIWG suddenly breaks
- Emergency fixes required (diverts maintainer from roadmap)
- Negative community perception ("unreliable framework")
- Potential data loss if artifact formats incompatible

**Risk Score**: 6 (High Priority)

**Mitigation Strategy**:
1. **API Compliance**: Use only documented Claude Code APIs (no undocumented hacks)
2. **Abstraction Layer**: Maintain platform abstraction in deploy-agents.mjs (already supports --provider flag)
3. **Vendor Monitoring**: Subscribe to Claude Code changelog, release notes, developer forums
4. **Automated Testing**: CI/CD tests catch API breakage immediately (not just on user reports)
5. **Version Pinning**: Document compatible platform versions in README
6. **Graceful Degradation**: Design commands to fail safely with clear error messages

**Contingency Plan**:
1. Emergency hotfix workflow (prioritize over roadmap features)
2. Notify users immediately via GitHub Discussions, README banner
3. Provide migration guide if API changes require user action
4. Fallback to previous platform version if possible (document rollback steps)
5. Engage platform vendor support channels for clarification/assistance

**Owner**: DevOps Lead (Joseph Magly)
**Status**: ACTIVE
**Next Review**: Weekly during Inception, Monthly after Phase 2

**Metrics**:
- Platform vendor changelog monitoring: Weekly
- API compatibility tests: Run on every CI build
- User-reported breakage incidents: Target 0 per quarter

---

### R-TECH-02: Quality Gate False Positives/Negatives

**Category**: Technical - Quality Assurance
**ID**: R-TECH-02

**Description**: Automated quality gates (markdown lint, manifest sync, documentation completeness) either reject valid contributions (false positives) or accept low-quality PRs (false negatives). This undermines contributor trust and maintainer efficiency.

**Probability**: Medium (2)
- First implementation of comprehensive quality gates
- Thresholds (80-90/100) untested at scale
- Linting rules may not cover all quality dimensions

**Impact**: Medium (2)
- False positives: Contributors frustrated, abandon PRs, negative perception
- False negatives: Maintainer reviews poor quality PRs, wastes time, technical debt
- Threshold tuning requires data, not available until Phase 2

**Risk Score**: 4 (High Priority)

**Mitigation Strategy**:
1. **Conservative Thresholds**: Start at 80/100 (accessible), tune based on Phase 2 data
2. **Manual Override**: Maintainer can approve <80 if quality gates overly strict
3. **Gate Transparency**: Clear explanations of why PR failed each check (not just "quality score 78")
4. **Incremental Rollout**: Deploy gates to test cohort first, refine before public launch
5. **Escape Hatch**: Contributors can request manual review if gates blocking incorrectly
6. **Continuous Improvement**: Quarterly review of gate false positive/negative rates

**Contingency Plan**:
1. Disable overly strict gates if >30% false positive rate detected
2. Fast-track fixes to quality gate logic (treat as bugs, not enhancements)
3. Communicate threshold changes transparently (GitHub Discussions)
4. Offer manual review for all rejected PRs during tuning period (Phase 2)

**Owner**: Quality Lead (Joseph Magly)
**Status**: ACTIVE
**Next Review**: Weekly during Phase 2, Bi-weekly during Phase 3

**Metrics**:
- False positive rate: Target <10% (contributor appeals gate rejection, maintainer approves)
- False negatives rate: Target <5% (maintainer identifies quality issues missed by gates)
- Quality gate appeals: Track and review monthly

---

### R-TECH-03: Integration Test Coverage Gaps

**Category**: Technical - Testing
**ID**: R-TECH-03

**Description**: Manual testing during Inception phase misses edge cases, platform-specific issues, or interaction bugs. Contributors encounter issues not caught in pre-submission validation, eroding confidence in quality gates.

**Probability**: High (3)
- Manual testing inherently incomplete
- Multiple platforms (Claude, OpenAI, Cursor, Windsurf) = combinatorial explosion
- Contributor environments vary (OS, shell, git config)

**Impact**: Medium (2)
- User-reported bugs after "quality gate passed" → trust erosion
- Maintainer time spent reproducing, debugging, patching
- Negative reviews ("broken on my machine")

**Risk Score**: 6 (High Priority)

**Mitigation Strategy**:
1. **Test Matrix**: Define critical paths (fork → develop → test → PR on Linux, macOS, WSL)
2. **Dogfooding First**: Maintainer uses contributor workflow before external release (catch issues early)
3. **Early Tester Diversity**: Recruit testers with varied environments (OS, platforms, configurations)
4. **Automated E2E Tests**: CI/CD runs contributor workflow commands in matrix (planned Phase 2)
5. **Issue Templates**: Capture environment details in bug reports (OS, platform, AIWG version)
6. **Known Issues Documentation**: Transparent about limitations (e.g., "Cursor support experimental")

**Contingency Plan**:
1. Hotfix workflow for critical bugs (<24 hour turnaround)
2. Rollback mechanism if release breaks existing functionality
3. "Beta" label for new platform integrations until validated by 3+ users
4. User compensation: Prioritize bug fixes for affected users, recognize in CONTRIBUTORS.md

**Owner**: Test Lead (Joseph Magly)
**Status**: ACTIVE
**Next Review**: After Phase 1 completion, Weekly during Phase 2

**Metrics**:
- Bug severity distribution: Target 0 critical (project-blocking), <3 high per month
- Mean time to resolution: <48 hours for critical, <1 week for high
- Test coverage: 80%+ critical paths by Phase 3

---

### R-TECH-04: Performance Degradation at Scale

**Category**: Technical - Performance
**ID**: R-TECH-04

**Description**: AIWG commands slow significantly as artifact volume grows (e.g., 100+ intake forms, 50+ ADRs). Contributor workflow commands timeout or become unusably slow, blocking productivity.

**Probability**: Low (1)
- Current artifact volume low (<50 files in `.aiwg/`)
- Commands optimized for small-medium projects (tested up to ~500 files)
- Unlikely to hit limits in Phase 1-3

**Impact**: Medium (2)
- User frustration if commands take >10 seconds
- Workarounds required (manual operations, partial automation)
- Negative perception ("framework doesn't scale")

**Risk Score**: 2 (Medium Priority)

**Mitigation Strategy**:
1. **Performance Baseline**: Measure command execution time during Phase 1 (establish SLAs)
2. **Caching**: Implement manifest caching, incremental updates (not full regeneration)
3. **Lazy Loading**: Load only required artifacts (not entire `.aiwg/` tree)
4. **Optimization Roadmap**: Document performance improvement tasks if thresholds exceeded
5. **Scalability Testing**: Run contributor workflow on large project (1000+ files) in Phase 3

**Contingency Plan**:
1. Document performance limits transparently (README: "optimized for projects <10,000 files")
2. Provide optimization tips (e.g., `.aiwgignore` for large codebases)
3. Prioritize performance fixes if users report issues (escalate to roadmap)
4. Consider architectural refactoring if fundamental limits reached (e.g., database instead of file-based)

**Owner**: Architecture Designer (Joseph Magly)
**Status**: ACTIVE (Monitoring)
**Next Review**: After Phase 3 (earliest Month 4)

**Metrics**:
- Command execution time: Target <3 seconds for 90% of operations
- Performance regression tests: Run on CI for critical commands
- User-reported performance issues: Target 0 per quarter

---

### R-TECH-05: Security Vulnerabilities in Dependencies

**Category**: Technical - Security
**ID**: R-TECH-05

**Description**: Node.js dependencies (markdownlint, js-yaml, etc.) contain security vulnerabilities (CVEs). Users or security scanners flag AIWG as insecure, blocking enterprise adoption.

**Probability**: Medium (2)
- Node.js ecosystem has frequent CVEs
- 22 Node.js tools in AIWG (larger attack surface)
- Automated scanners (Dependabot, Snyk) will eventually flag issues

**Impact**: Medium (2)
- Enterprise adoption blocked (security policies prohibit vulnerable dependencies)
- Negative perception ("insecure framework")
- Remediation effort required (dependency updates, testing, releases)

**Risk Score**: 4 (High Priority)

**Mitigation Strategy**:
1. **Automated Scanning**: Enable Dependabot, Snyk, or npm audit in CI/CD
2. **Regular Updates**: Monthly dependency updates (not just when CVEs discovered)
3. **Minimal Dependencies**: Avoid unnecessary packages, prefer standard library
4. **Security Policy**: Document vulnerability disclosure process (SECURITY.md)
5. **Rapid Response**: <7 day SLA for critical CVEs, <30 days for high severity

**Contingency Plan**:
1. Emergency release workflow for critical CVEs (<24 hour turnaround)
2. Notify users immediately via GitHub Security Advisories
3. Provide migration guide if dependency update breaks compatibility
4. Consider alternative packages if maintainer abandons vulnerable dependency

**Owner**: Security Lead (Joseph Magly)
**Status**: ACTIVE
**Next Review**: Monthly (automated via Dependabot)

**Metrics**:
- Known CVEs: Target 0 critical, 0 high severity
- Dependency update frequency: At least monthly
- Mean time to CVE remediation: <7 days critical, <30 days high

## PROCESS RISKS

### R-PROC-01: Process Overhead Kills Velocity (CRITICAL)

**Category**: Process - SDLC Efficiency
**ID**: R-PROC-01

**Description**: Full SDLC artifacts (intake, SAD, ADRs, test plans, deployment docs) slow contributor workflow development to 2x+ previous feature velocity. Maintainer and contributors perceive framework as bureaucratic overhead, abandon adoption. This is the HIGHEST CREDIBILITY RISK - if AIWG can't ship fast using AIWG, nobody will believe it works.

**Probability**: High (3)
- First full SDLC run (no historical data on overhead)
- Previous features (Warp integration, intake commands) shipped without formal artifacts
- Solo maintainer balancing documentation vs code (time pressure)

**Impact**: High (3)
- Undermines core value proposition ("AIWG enhances velocity, not hinders")
- Contributor abandonment if workflow too complex
- Maintainer burnout if process unsustainable
- Self-application demonstration fails (incomplete artifacts or missed deadlines)

**Risk Score**: 9 (CRITICAL - Top Priority)

**Mitigation Strategy**:
1. **Agent-Assisted Generation**: Use AIWG agents to draft artifacts (SAD, test plans), not manual writing
2. **Iterative Artifacts**: Ship v0.1 of documents, refine in Phase 2 (not perfection up-front)
3. **Velocity Tracking**: Measure time-to-PR vs previous features (Warp: ~1 week, target <2 weeks for contributor workflow)
4. **Ruthless Scope Management**: Cut non-critical features from Phase 1 to meet 4-week timeline
5. **Template Reuse**: Leverage existing AIWG templates (don't reinvent every artifact)
6. **Parallel Workstreams**: Generate artifacts in parallel with development (not sequential gates)
7. **Time Boxing**: If artifact generation takes >20% of development time, simplify or defer

**Contingency Plan**:
1. **Emergency Simplification**: If velocity >2x previous features, reduce rigor (e.g., skip detailed test plan, use checklist)
2. **Transparent Communication**: Publish retrospective on friction points, document learnings
3. **Process Refinement**: Identify bottleneck artifacts, streamline for future features
4. **Scope Reduction**: Ship MVP contributor workflow (core commands only), defer advanced features to Phase 2
5. **Accept Technical Debt**: Document shortcuts taken, plan paydown in Phase 2

**Owner**: Process Lead (Joseph Magly)
**Status**: ACTIVE (Under Active Monitoring)
**Next Review**: Weekly during Inception (measure velocity continuously)

**Metrics**:
- Time-to-PR ratio: Target <2x previous features (Warp: 7 days, contributor workflow: <14 days)
- Artifact generation time: Target <20% of total development time
- Retrospective friction points: Capture and prioritize improvements

**Phase 1 Mitigation Timeline**:
- **Week 1**: Establish velocity baseline (measure Warp integration retrospectively)
- **Week 2**: Draft SAD and ADRs using architecture-designer agent (target <2 days)
- **Week 3**: Implement core commands, run parallel test validation (not sequential)
- **Week 4**: Deployment plan and final artifacts (use templates, not custom)

---

### R-PROC-02: Contributor Workflow Too Complex

**Category**: Process - Usability
**ID**: R-PROC-02

**Description**: Contributor workflow commands (`aiwg -contribute-*`) require too many steps, confusing parameters, or unclear error messages. Contributors abandon PRs mid-process, failing "time-to-first-PR <30 minutes" success criteria.

**Probability**: Medium (2)
- First version of contributor workflow (no user testing yet)
- Multiple commands required (start, test, pr, monitor, respond, sync)
- Contributors vary in experience (git novices to power users)

**Impact**: High (3)
- Phase 2 validation fails (contributors can't complete PRs)
- Community growth strategy blocked (no successful contributions)
- Negative perception ("AIWG too hard to use")

**Risk Score**: 6 (High Priority)

**Mitigation Strategy**:
1. **Single-Command Happy Path**: `aiwg -contribute-start feature-name` guides through entire workflow (prompts, not flags)
2. **Detailed Quickstart**: Contributor quickstart guide (already complete - 1,682 lines) walks through step-by-step
3. **Interactive Mode**: Commands prompt for missing parameters (not cryptic errors)
4. **Clear Error Messages**: Explain failures with actionable next steps (not just "validation failed")
5. **Dry-Run Mode**: `--dry-run` flag previews changes before executing
6. **Dogfooding**: Maintainer uses contributor workflow first, identifies friction points

**Contingency Plan**:
1. **UX Iteration**: Weekly refinements during Phase 2 based on tester feedback
2. **Wizard Mode**: Add `aiwg -contribute-wizard` for maximum hand-holding if needed
3. **Video Tutorial**: Record screencast if written guide insufficient
4. **1-on-1 Support**: White-glove assistance for early testers (not scalable, but validates workflow)

**Owner**: UX Lead (Joseph Magly)
**Status**: ACTIVE
**Next Review**: Weekly during Phase 2 (testing cohort feedback)

**Metrics**:
- Time-to-first-PR: Target 80%+ contributors <30 minutes (Phase 2)
- Command error rate: Target <10% (users recover without maintainer help)
- Contributor satisfaction: Target 4/5+ on ease-of-use rating

---

### R-PROC-03: Quality Gate Threshold Too High

**Category**: Process - Accessibility
**ID**: R-PROC-03

**Description**: 80-90/100 quality score threshold blocks legitimate contributions from less experienced developers. Contributors perceive AIWG as elitist, discouraging community participation and reducing diversity of contributions.

**Probability**: Low (1)
- Quality gates designed to be achievable (linting, documentation, not subjective code review)
- Contributors can iterate (fix linting, resubmit) without maintainer intervention
- Maintainer can override if gates too strict

**Impact**: Medium (2)
- Smaller contributor pool (excludes juniors, non-native English speakers)
- Homogeneous contributions (only power users participate)
- Negative community perception ("gatekeeping")

**Risk Score**: 2 (Medium Priority)

**Mitigation Strategy**:
1. **Transparent Criteria**: Quality score rubric clearly documented (not mysterious algorithm)
2. **Incremental Improvement**: Contributors see score increase as they fix issues (progress feedback)
3. **Help Mode**: `aiwg -contribute-test --help` explains how to improve score
4. **Manual Review Option**: Contributors can request maintainer review even if <80 (explained in error message)
5. **Threshold Tuning**: Monitor merge rate (target 80%+), lower threshold if too restrictive

**Contingency Plan**:
1. **Lower Threshold**: If <50% merge rate after Phase 2, reduce to 70/100
2. **Tiered Thresholds**: Different scores for different contribution types (docs: 70, code: 85, platform integrations: 80)
3. **Mentorship Program**: Pair experienced contributors with newcomers (if community grows)

**Owner**: Quality Lead (Joseph Magly)
**Status**: ACTIVE (Monitoring)
**Next Review**: After Phase 2 validation

**Metrics**:
- PR merge rate: Target 80%+ (indicates achievable standards)
- Quality gate appeals: Track requests for manual review
- Contributor diversity: Monitor junior vs experienced contributor ratio

---

### R-PROC-04: SDLC Documentation Drift

**Category**: Process - Maintenance
**ID**: R-PROC-04

**Description**: SDLC artifacts (SAD, ADRs, test plans) become outdated as implementation evolves. Code and documentation diverge, undermining traceability and credibility of self-application demonstration.

**Probability**: Medium (2)
- Common problem in fast-moving projects
- Solo maintainer may prioritize code over doc updates
- No automated validation that docs match implementation

**Impact**: Medium (2)
- Traceability broken (requirements don't match code)
- Self-application credibility damaged (visible outdated artifacts)
- Future maintainers confused (docs don't reflect reality)

**Risk Score**: 4 (High Priority)

**Mitigation Strategy**:
1. **Living Documents**: Treat SDLC artifacts as living (update with code changes, not write-once)
2. **Change Control**: ADRs document decisions as they're made (not retroactively)
3. **Review Checklist**: PR template includes "Update affected SDLC artifacts" checkbox
4. **Quarterly Sync**: Review `.aiwg/` artifacts for drift, update as needed
5. **Automated Checks**: Manifest sync validation, traceability matrix (check-traceability command)

**Contingency Plan**:
1. **Quarterly Audit**: Dedicated time to sync docs with implementation
2. **Version Artifacts**: Date stamp documents, mark outdated sections clearly
3. **Archive Old Versions**: Keep historical artifacts, link to updated versions
4. **Transparent About Drift**: README note "SDLC artifacts current as of [date]"

**Owner**: Documentation Lead (Joseph Magly)
**Status**: ACTIVE
**Next Review**: Quarterly starting Month 3

**Metrics**:
- Artifact drift incidents: User-reported mismatches between docs and code
- Traceability check pass rate: Target 95%+ (run monthly)
- Last update timestamps: No artifact >3 months stale

---

### R-PROC-05: Adoption Barrier for Non-Git Users

**Category**: Process - Accessibility
**ID**: R-PROC-05

**Description**: Contributor workflow assumes git expertise (forking, branching, rebasing, PR workflows). Non-git users (writers, designers, domain experts) can't contribute, limiting diversity of contributions.

**Probability**: Low (1)
- Primary contributors likely developers (platform integrations require code)
- Documentation contributions may attract non-git users
- GitHub UI offers some git abstraction (web-based editing)

**Impact**: Low (1)
- Smaller contributor pool (excludes non-technical contributors)
- Documentation contributions fewer (writers may struggle with git)
- Workaround exists (GitHub web UI, maintainer can assist)

**Risk Score**: 1 (Low Priority)

**Mitigation Strategy**:
1. **Web-Based Contributions**: Document GitHub web UI workflow (edit files in browser, no git CLI)
2. **Simplified Git Guide**: Quickstart includes minimal git commands (fork, clone, commit, push)
3. **Maintainer Assistance**: Offer to handle git mechanics for valuable non-code contributions
4. **Future Enhancement**: Consider non-git contribution paths (Google Docs → maintainer imports) if demand validates

**Contingency Plan**:
1. Accept contributions via email, Discord, GitHub Discussions (maintainer converts to PR)
2. Video tutorial for git novices (if documentation contributors struggle)
3. Mentorship: Pair non-git users with git-savvy contributors

**Owner**: Community Lead (Joseph Magly)
**Status**: ACTIVE (Low Priority)
**Next Review**: If non-git contributor demand emerges

**Metrics**:
- Non-git contributor requests: Track requests for alternative contribution paths
- Documentation PR volume: Monitor if non-git barrier limits doc contributions

---

## RESOURCE RISKS

### R-RES-01: Solo Maintainer Burnout (CRITICAL)

**Category**: Resource - Capacity
**ID**: R-RES-01

**Description**: Joseph Magly (solo maintainer) overwhelmed by development + PR review + support + roadmap planning. Quality degradation, slow responses, or project abandonment risk. Current velocity: 35+ commits/month, adding PR review burden without automation could exceed sustainable capacity.

**Probability**: High (3)
- Solo maintainer with 100% of responsibilities
- Community contributions add review burden (target 3+ per quarter)
- Support requests increase with user growth (currently 0, planning 10+ by Month 6)
- No backup if maintainer unavailable (vacation, illness, other commitments)

**Impact**: High (3)
- Project stalls or abandoned (single point of failure)
- Contributor frustration (slow PR reviews, unresponsive maintainer)
- Quality degradation (rushed reviews, missed bugs)
- Negative community perception ("dead project")

**Risk Score**: 9 (CRITICAL - Top Priority)

**Mitigation Strategy**:
1. **Automation**: Quality gates catch 90%+ issues before maintainer review (reduce manual effort 50%)
2. **Self-Service Workflows**: Contributor commands guide through entire process (minimize support requests)
3. **Time Boundaries**: Document maintainer availability (e.g., "PRs reviewed within 3 days, support Mon-Fri")
4. **Ruthless Prioritization**: Focus on high-impact work (PR review, critical bugs), defer nice-to-haves
5. **Recruit 2nd Maintainer**: Target Month 6 (promote successful contributor or recruit externally)
6. **Maintenance Periods**: Schedule "maintenance only" sprints (no new features, just stability)
7. **Monitor Workload**: Track hours/week on AIWG, escalate if exceeds sustainable threshold (10-15 hours)

**Contingency Plan**:
1. **Pause Community Growth**: Stop recruiting contributors if review backlog exceeds 5 PRs
2. **Emergency Maintainer Recruitment**: Accelerate 2nd maintainer search if burnout signs emerge
3. **Reduce Scope**: Cut roadmap features, focus on stability and existing users
4. **Temporary Hiatus**: Transparent communication if maintainer needs break (better than silent abandonment)
5. **Project Handoff**: Document knowledge transfer process if maintainer must step away

**Owner**: Project Owner (Joseph Magly)
**Status**: ACTIVE (Under Active Monitoring)
**Next Review**: Weekly (self-assessment of capacity)

**Metrics**:
- Weekly time allocation: Track hours on AIWG (development, review, support)
- PR review backlog: Target <3 days median cycle time, max 5 open PRs
- Support volume: Track GitHub issues, discussions, questions
- Burnout indicators: Slow responses (>3 days), quality issues, missed commitments

**Phase 1 Mitigation Timeline**:
- **Week 1-4**: Build automation (quality gates, self-service tools)
- **Month 2-3**: Monitor workload, validate 50% review time reduction target
- **Month 6**: Recruit 2nd maintainer (or reassess if automation sufficient)

---

### R-RES-02: Insufficient Funding for Infrastructure

**Category**: Resource - Funding
**ID**: R-RES-02

**Description**: AIWG growth requires paid infrastructure (hosting, CI/CD minutes, domain, CDN). Solo maintainer funding insufficient if costs exceed personal budget.

**Probability**: Low (1)
- Current costs minimal (GitHub free tier, no hosting)
- CI/CD within free tier limits (GitHub Actions 2000 min/month)
- Unlikely to exceed free tiers in Phase 1-3

**Impact**: Low (1)
- Workarounds available (reduce CI runs, use free alternatives)
- Community support possible (GitHub Sponsors, donations)
- Not project-blocking (core functionality doesn't require paid infra)

**Risk Score**: 1 (Low Priority)

**Mitigation Strategy**:
1. **Free Tier Optimization**: Stay within GitHub free tier (2000 CI minutes/month)
2. **Selective CI**: Run expensive tests only on critical branches (main, PRs), not every commit
3. **Community Funding**: Enable GitHub Sponsors if costs emerge
4. **Sponsorship**: Approach vendors (Anthropic, OpenAI) for infrastructure credits if needed

**Contingency Plan**:
1. Request community funding (GitHub Sponsors, OpenCollective)
2. Reduce CI coverage (manual testing for non-critical paths)
3. Seek vendor sponsorship (cloud credits, CI minutes)
4. Accept infrastructure limits (documented in README)

**Owner**: DevOps Lead (Joseph Magly)
**Status**: ACTIVE (Low Risk)
**Next Review**: Quarterly (monitor costs)

**Metrics**:
- Monthly infrastructure costs: Track actual spend
- CI/CD minute usage: Monitor GitHub Actions quota
- Community funding: Track if sponsors enabled

---

### R-RES-03: Key Contributor Departure

**Category**: Resource - Team
**ID**: R-RES-03

**Description**: Early contributors (testers, platform integrators) lose interest or availability. Momentum stalls if contributors don't follow through on PRs or testing commitments.

**Probability**: Medium (2)
- Volunteers with competing priorities
- No financial incentives (open source contribution)
- Contributor burnout from complex workflows

**Impact**: Low (1)
- Phase 2 validation delayed (need to recruit replacement testers)
- Platform integration velocity reduced (fewer contributors)
- Not project-blocking (maintainer can continue solo)

**Risk Score**: 2 (Medium Priority)

**Mitigation Strategy**:
1. **Over-Recruit**: Target 5 testers vs minimum 2 (expect attrition)
2. **Low Time Commitment**: Clearly communicate 30 min testing + 15 min survey (not ongoing obligation)
3. **Recognition**: Public thanks in CONTRIBUTORS.md, case study co-authorship
4. **Flexible Engagement**: Contributors choose involvement level (no pressure)
5. **Pipeline**: Continuous recruitment (don't depend on single cohort)

**Contingency Plan**:
1. Extend Phase 2 timeline if tester attrition high
2. Recruit replacement contributors from broader community
3. Maintainer testing if contributors insufficient (less diverse feedback)
4. Reduce testing scope (validate core workflows only)

**Owner**: Community Lead (Joseph Magly)
**Status**: ACTIVE
**Next Review**: After Phase 2 (measure retention)

**Metrics**:
- Contributor retention: % completing testing commitments
- Recruitment pipeline: # interested contributors in queue
- Contribution diversity: Track platform, experience level variety

---

### R-RES-04: Team Growth Coordination Overhead

**Category**: Resource - Team Management
**ID**: R-RES-04

**Description**: Growing from solo maintainer to 2-3 person team introduces coordination overhead (meetings, decision-making, merge conflicts). Velocity decreases instead of increasing.

**Probability**: Medium (2)
- Team scaling challenges common (Brooks' Law)
- Part-time contributors harder to coordinate than full-time
- Unclear roles/responsibilities initially

**Impact**: Medium (2)
- Velocity decrease short-term (onboarding, coordination)
- Decision paralysis if consensus required for everything
- Merge conflicts, duplicated work without coordination

**Risk Score**: 4 (High Priority)

**Mitigation Strategy**:
1. **Clear Ownership**: Assign domains (security, documentation, platform X) to avoid overlap
2. **Async-First**: Document decisions, minimize meetings (GitHub Discussions, ADRs)
3. **Decision Framework**: Document who decides what (maintainer veto, consensus, individual autonomy)
4. **Shadowing Period**: New maintainers pair on PRs before independent merges (reduce mistakes)
5. **Weekly Sync**: Short status sync (async via GitHub if possible)

**Contingency Plan**:
1. Reduce team size if coordination exceeds benefits (stay solo or 2 max)
2. Hire part-time coordinator if maintainers need management support
3. Tools: Use project boards, CODEOWNERS, GitHub teams to clarify ownership

**Owner**: Project Owner (Joseph Magly)
**Status**: PLANNED (Deferred until Month 6)
**Next Review**: When 2nd maintainer recruited

**Metrics**:
- Decision latency: Time from question to resolution (target <48 hours)
- Merge conflicts: Frequency of coordination issues
- Team satisfaction: Quarterly survey (if team forms)

## EXTERNAL RISKS

### R-EXT-01: Competitor Framework Gains Traction

**Category**: External - Market Competition
**ID**: R-EXT-01

**Description**: Alternative SDLC frameworks for agentic development emerge with better UX, more features, or vendor backing. AIWG loses mindshare, user adoption stalls.

**Probability**: Medium (2)
- Agentic development hot space (competitors likely)
- AIWG early but not first-mover (risk of being leap-frogged)
- Well-funded competitors could move faster

**Impact**: Medium (2)
- User adoption slower (smaller market share)
- Contributor interest decreases (momentum to competitor)
- Not project-killing (AIWG can coexist, differentiate)

**Risk Score**: 4 (High Priority)

**Mitigation Strategy**:
1. **Differentiation**: Self-application demonstration is unique (hard to copy credibly)
2. **Modular Design**: AIWG components reusable even if users adopt different frameworks
3. **Open Source Advantage**: Community can fork, extend, outlive commercial competitors

### R-EXT-02: Agentic Development Fad Fades

**Category**: External - Market Trends
**ID**: R-EXT-02

**Description**: Agentic development (Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf) proves to be short-term hype. Market shifts to different AI-assisted workflows, AIWG's target market shrinks.

**Probability**: Low (1)
- Agentic development growing rapidly (platform investment increasing)
- Paradigm shift unlikely short-term (but possible long-term 2-5 years)
- AIWG addresses broader SDLC need (not just agentic-specific)

**Impact**: High (3)
- Target market shrinks (fewer agentic developers)
- Platform vendor support decreases (Anthropic, OpenAI pivot)
- AIWG becomes niche tool (not mainstream)

**Risk Score**: 3 (Medium Priority)

**Mitigation Strategy**:
1. **Platform Agnostic**: AIWG works beyond agentic platforms (general SDLC framework)
2. **Portable Artifacts**: `.aiwg/` documents useful regardless of development method
3. **Core Value**: Structured SDLC valuable even if AI-assisted coding declines
4. **Diversify Use Cases**: Enterprise compliance, audit trails (not just agentic speed)

**Contingency Plan**:
1. **Pivot Positioning**: Reframe AIWG as general SDLC framework (de-emphasize agentic focus)
2. **Enterprise Focus**: Compliance and governance use cases less trend-dependent
3. **Archive Project**: If market disappears, maintain stability for existing users (no new features)

**Owner**: Product Strategist (Joseph Magly)
**Status**: ACTIVE (Low Probability)
**Next Review**: Annually

**Metrics**:
- Agentic platform growth: Monitor Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf user bases
- AIWG positioning: Track if users adopt for non-agentic reasons
- Market sentiment: Developer surveys, conference trends

### R-EXT-03: Regulatory Changes Require Compliance Features

**Category**: External - Regulatory
**ID**: R-EXT-03

**Description**: New regulations (AI Act, data privacy, software supply chain security) require features AIWG doesn't support. Enterprise adoption blocked until compliance templates added.

**Probability**: Low (1)
- Regulations evolve slowly (2-5 year horizon)
- AIWG's audit trail architecture partially compliant already
- Maintainer's enterprise background enables rapid adaptation if needed

**Impact**: Medium (2)
- Enterprise market blocked (compliance gap)
- Rushed feature development (quality risk)
- Competitive disadvantage if competitors move faster

**Risk Score**: 2 (Medium Priority)

**Mitigation Strategy**:
1. **Monitor Regulations**: Track EU AI Act, US EO on AI, supply chain security requirements
2. **Audit Trail Foundation**: AIWG's traceability architecture adaptable to compliance needs
3. **Modular Compliance**: Design templates as add-ons (not core framework changes)
4. **Community Contributions**: Recruit compliance experts to contribute templates
5. **Defer Until Needed**: Don't build speculatively (wait for demand signal)

**Contingency Plan**:
1. **Rapid Template Development**: Maintainer's enterprise background enables <1 month template creation
2. **Partner with Compliance Firms**: Outsource template development if demand high
3. **Open Source Collaboration**: Community PRs for compliance templates (distributed effort)

**Owner**: Compliance Specialist (Future Role)
**Status**: ACTIVE (Monitoring)
**Next Review**: Quarterly

**Metrics**:
- Regulatory developments: Track AI Act, supply chain security laws
- Enterprise compliance requests: Track user demand for SOC2, HIPAA, ISO27001
- Compliance template coverage: % of common frameworks supported

### R-EXT-04: Platform Vendor Acquires/Partners with Competitor

**Category**: External - Strategic Partnerships
**ID**: R-EXT-04

**Description**: Anthropic (Claude Code) or OpenAI partners with or acquires competing SDLC framework. AIWG disadvantaged by lack of official vendor support.

**Probability**: Low (1)
- Vendors focused on core platform (not SDLC tooling currently)
- Open ecosystem benefits vendors (unlikely to pick exclusive partner)
- AIWG too small to be acquisition target (currently)

**Impact**: Medium (2)
- Competitive disadvantage (official vendor endorsement valuable)
- User migration to vendor-preferred framework
- Platform API access potentially restricted

**Risk Score**: 2 (Medium Priority)

**Mitigation Strategy**:
1. **Quality First**: Build best-in-class framework (hard for vendors to ignore)
2. **Open Standards**: Use portable formats, avoid vendor lock-in
3. **Multi-Platform**: Support Claude, OpenAI, Cursor (not single-vendor dependent)
4. **Community Moat**: Build loyal user base (harder for vendor to displace)
5. **Vendor Engagement**: Build relationships with platform teams (visibility)

**Contingency Plan**:
1. **Coexistence**: Position as complementary to vendor-preferred tools (not competitor)
2. **Differentiation**: Focus on features vendor frameworks lack (e.g., compliance)
3. **API Stability**: Use documented APIs only (avoid dependencies on vendor goodwill)
4. **Fork Protection**: Open source license ensures community can fork if needed

**Owner**: Product Strategist (Joseph Magly)
**Status**: ACTIVE (Low Probability)
**Next Review**: Annually

**Metrics**:
- Vendor partnership announcements: Monitor platform vendor strategic moves
- API stability: Track breaking changes, restrictions
- User sentiment: Monitor if vendor preference influences adoption decisions

## CREDIBILITY RISKS

### R-CRED-01: Self-Application Reveals Framework Flaws (CRITICAL)

**Category**: Credibility - Dogfooding Validation
**ID**: R-CRED-01

**Description**: Using AIWG to develop contributor workflow exposes significant gaps, inefficiencies, or broken workflows. Public self-application artifacts reveal framework immaturity, damaging credibility before community adoption scales.

**Probability**: Medium (2)
- First full SDLC self-application (no historical validation)
- Framework experimental (expect issues)
- Friction points visible in `.aiwg/` artifacts (transparent demonstration)

**Impact**: High (3)
- Credibility damage ("AIWG recommends processes it can't execute itself")
- User confidence eroded ("framework not ready for production")
- Competitor ammunition ("look how broken AIWG's own artifacts are")
- Community adoption delayed (users wait for maturity)

**Risk Score**: 6 (High Priority)

**Mitigation Strategy**:
1. **Embrace Imperfection**: Frame as "learning in public" not "perfect demonstration"
2. **Transparent Retrospectives**: Document friction points openly (turns weakness into learning)
3. **Iterate Rapidly**: Fix issues discovered during dogfooding (before external release)
4. **Lower Expectations**: Communicate "v1.0 self-application" (not claiming mastery)
5. **Highlight Learnings**: Retrospectives show framework improving from dogfooding (positive spin)
6. **Parallel Validation**: Phase 2 testing with external contributors (not just solo maintainer)

**Contingency Plan**:
1. **Retrospective Publication**: "What We Learned Dogfooding AIWG" blog post (honesty builds trust)
2. **Framework Improvements**: Prioritize fixes to issues discovered (show responsiveness)
3. **Artifact Cleanup**: Refine `.aiwg/` artifacts before promoting as reference implementation
4. **Delayed Promotion**: If issues severe, delay publicizing self-application until polished
5. **Alternative Demonstration**: Use smaller feature (markdown linting) if contributor workflow too messy

**Owner**: Vision Owner (Joseph Magly)
**Status**: ACTIVE (High Visibility Risk)
**Next Review**: Weekly during Inception, After Phase 1 completion

**Metrics**:
- Friction points discovered: Track dogfooding issues in retrospective
- Framework improvements: % of friction points resolved before Phase 2
- User perception: Monitor GitHub Discussions, social media sentiment

**Phase 1 Mitigation Timeline**:
- **Week 1-4**: Capture friction points transparently (don't hide issues)
- **Week 4**: Comprehensive retrospective (learnings documented)
- **Week 5-8**: Fix critical issues before Phase 2 launch
- **Month 3**: Publish "learnings from dogfooding" case study (transparent communication)

---

### R-CRED-02: Incomplete SDLC Artifacts Visible

**Category**: Credibility - Quality Perception
**ID**: R-CRED-02

**Description**: Time pressure or velocity constraints result in incomplete, rushed, or low-quality SDLC artifacts in `.aiwg/planning/contributor-workflow/`. Users see gaps and question framework value.

**Probability**: Medium (2)
- Solo maintainer balancing multiple responsibilities
- 4-week Phase 1 timeline aggressive for full SDLC
- Risk of cutting corners to meet deadlines

**Impact**: Medium (2)
- Credibility damage (visible poor-quality artifacts)
- Self-application demonstration weakened (incomplete proof)
- User confusion ("which artifacts are actually required?")

**Risk Score**: 4 (High Priority)

**Mitigation Strategy**:
1. **Minimum Viable Artifacts**: Define "complete enough" threshold (not perfection)
2. **Version Labeling**: Mark artifacts as "v1.0 - will evolve" (set expectations)
3. **Prioritize Critical Artifacts**: Ensure intake, SAD, ADRs complete (test plans can be lighter)
4. **Agent Assistance**: Use AIWG agents to draft artifacts quickly (not manual effort)
5. **Defer Non-Critical**: Ship Phase 1 with core artifacts, refine in Phase 2

**Contingency Plan**:
1. **Scope Reduction**: If falling behind, cut optional artifacts (focus on intake, architecture)
2. **Phase 1 Extension**: Add 1-2 weeks if critical artifacts incomplete (better late than rushed)
3. **Transparent Labeling**: Mark incomplete artifacts clearly ("placeholder - to be refined")
4. **Deferred Launch**: Delay Phase 2 testing until artifacts meet minimum quality bar

**Owner**: Quality Lead (Joseph Magly)
**Status**: ACTIVE
**Next Review**: Weekly during Inception

**Metrics**:
- Artifact completeness: Checklist of required documents (track completion %)
- Quality scores: Self-assess artifacts against AIWG quality gates
- User feedback: Monitor if incomplete artifacts mentioned negatively

### R-CRED-03: Maintainer Not Using Contributor Workflow

**Category**: Credibility - Consistency
**ID**: R-CRED-03

**Description**: Maintainer bypasses contributor workflow for subsequent features (uses shortcuts, doesn't follow own process). Users notice inconsistency, perceive as "do as I say, not as I do."

**Probability**: Low (1)
- Maintainer committed to self-application (strategic priority)
- Phase 1-3 roadmap enforces process (not optional)
- Visible artifacts create accountability

**Impact**: High (3)
- Severe credibility damage ("maintainer doesn't believe in own framework")
- User adoption collapses ("if maintainer doesn't use it, why should I?")
- Community trust broken (difficult to recover)

**Risk Score**: 3 (Medium Priority)

**Mitigation Strategy**:
1. **Public Accountability**: Roadmap commits to 100% dogfooding for new features
2. **Artifact Visibility**: All new features require `.aiwg/` artifacts before merging
3. **PR Template**: Maintainer PRs include "SDLC artifacts location" field
4. **Retrospectives**: Document adherence to process (or deviations with rationale)
5. **Community Oversight**: Contributors can flag if maintainer bypasses process

**Contingency Plan**:
1. **Transparent Explanation**: If shortcuts taken, document why (e.g., emergency hotfix)
2. **Retroactive Artifacts**: Generate missing SDLC docs if shipped without
3. **Process Refinement**: If workflow too burdensome for maintainer, simplify (not bypass)

**Owner**: Vision Owner (Joseph Magly)
**Status**: ACTIVE
**Next Review**: Quarterly (audit maintainer adherence)

**Metrics**:
- Feature SDLC coverage: % of new features with complete `.aiwg/` artifacts
- Deviation incidents: Count of features shipped without full artifacts
- Community feedback: Monitor user mentions of maintainer consistency

### R-CRED-04: Competitor Cites AIWG as "Over-Engineered"

**Category**: Credibility - Market Perception
**ID**: R-CRED-04

**Description**: Competitors or critics frame AIWG as overly complex, bureaucratic, or enterprise-heavy. Developer community rejects as "not worth the overhead."

**Probability**: Medium (2)
- Developer culture often anti-process (agile backlash, move fast ethos)
- SDLC frameworks perceived as heavyweight
- Competitors may amplify criticism

**Impact**: Medium (2)
- User adoption slower (perception barrier)
- Community discussions negative (HN, Reddit)
- Difficulty recruiting contributors (stigma)

**Risk Score**: 4 (High Priority)

**Mitigation Strategy**:
1. **Messaging**: Emphasize "modular" (use what you need), not "comprehensive" (use everything)
2. **Speed Proof**: Velocity metrics show AIWG enhances speed (not hinders)
3. **Lightweight Start**: Quickstart uses minimal subset (not full enterprise rigor)
4. **Community Champions**: Users share success stories (counter negative narrative)
5. **Competitor Respect**: Acknowledge alternative approaches (not defensive positioning)

**Contingency Plan**:
1. **Rebranding**: De-emphasize "comprehensive SDLC" if stigma too strong (focus on "AI-assisted workflows")
2. **Simplified Tier**: Offer "AIWG Lite" mode (intake + ADRs only, no full SDLC)
3. **Case Studies**: Showcase small projects using AIWG (not just enterprise)
4. **Influencer Outreach**: Engage thought leaders to review fairly (not dismissively)

**Owner**: Product Strategist (Joseph Magly)
**Status**: ACTIVE
**Next Review**: Quarterly (monitor sentiment)

**Metrics**:
- Community sentiment: Track HN, Reddit, Twitter mentions (positive vs negative)
- "Over-engineered" mentions: Count criticisms of complexity
- User retention: Monitor if users adopt then abandon (signal of overhead)

---

### R-CRED-05: No Visible Community Contributions

**Category**: Credibility - Community Validation
**ID**: R-CRED-05

**Description**: Phase 2-3 contributor recruitment fails. No community PRs merged, only maintainer commits visible. Users perceive as "solo project" not "community framework."

**Probability**: Low (1)
- Early user testing should validate contributor interest
- Platform integrations clear value prop (Cursor, Windsurf users motivated)
- Quality gates may be barrier, but solvable

**Impact**: Medium (2)
- Market validation missing (no proof others can contribute)
- Network effects fail (community doesn't form)
- Maintainer burnout risk increases (no help)

**Risk Score**: 2 (Medium Priority)

**Mitigation Strategy**:
1. **Early Testing**: Phase 2 cohort validates contributor workflow before scaling
2. **Clear Value Prop**: Platform integrations obvious benefit (users want their platform supported)
3. **Reduce Friction**: Contributor workflow designed for <30 min time-to-PR
4. **Recognition**: Public thanks, CONTRIBUTORS.md, co-authorship (incentivize participation)
5. **Pipeline Building**: Continuous recruitment (don't depend on single cohort)

**Contingency Plan**:
1. **Pivot to Personal Tool**: If community doesn't form, document as "solo maintainer framework" (honest positioning)
2. **Commercial Support**: Offer paid integration services if volunteers don't emerge
3. **Lower Quality Bar**: Reduce threshold to 70/100 if 80-90 too restrictive
4. **Maintainer Contributions**: Seed initial platform integrations (demonstrate value, others follow)

**Owner**: Community Lead (Joseph Magly)
**Status**: ACTIVE
**Next Review**: After Phase 2 validation

**Metrics**:
- Community PRs merged: Target 3+ per quarter starting Month 4
- Contributor count: Unique contributors (target 5+ within 6 months)
- Contributor retention: % of Phase 2 testers who submit PRs later
