## Executive Summary

### Risk Overview

The AI Writing Guide framework faces **19 identified risks** across Business, Technical, Resource, Schedule, and Security categories. The project's overall risk level is **MEDIUM-HIGH**, primarily driven by the solo developer resource constraint and unproven market adoption.

### Top 5 Critical Risks

1. **RISK-004** (Show Stopper): Solo Developer Burnout - **ACTIVE MITIGATION**
   - Current mitigation: Time budgeting (<10 hrs/week), ship-now mindset, accept technical debt
   - Status: Actively monitoring weekly time investment

2. **RISK-001** (HIGH): Zero Adoption Post-Launch - **MITIGATION PLANNED**
   - Mitigation: Pre-launch user recruitment via Reddit/Discord, clear pivot triggers defined
   - Trigger: <5 stars after 3 months → accept personal-tool path

3. **RISK-TECH-001** (HIGH): Modular Deployment Complexity - **MITIGATION IN PROGRESS**
   - Mitigation: Auto-detect deployment mode, interactive wizard planned for v0.2
   - Success metric: 80% correct mode selection first attempt

4. **RISK-TECH-005** (HIGH): Self-Application Loop Viability - **MONITORING**
   - Mitigation: Gradual adoption (major features only first 3 months)
   - Trigger: >50% overhead on 3 consecutive features → pivot away

5. **RISK-005** (HIGH): Contributor Recruitment Fails - **MITIGATION PLANNED**
   - Mitigation: Lower barriers, diverse contribution types, active outreach
   - Checkpoint: 6 months - need 2-3 contributors or unsustainable

### Overall Risk Level: **MEDIUM-HIGH**

- **Show Stopper Risks**: 1 (with active mitigation)
- **HIGH Impact Risks**: 8 total (5 business/resource, 3 technical)
- **MEDIUM Impact Risks**: 8 total
- **LOW Impact Risks**: 2 total

|--------------|------------------|-------------------|
| SHOW STOPPER | Weekly | Time logs, health checks |
| HIGH | Bi-weekly | Metrics tracking, trigger monitoring |
| MEDIUM | Monthly | Checkpoint reviews |
| LOW | Quarterly | Periodic assessment |

### Weekly Monitoring
- Solo developer time investment (target: <10 hrs/week)
- Support capacity (target: <3 hrs/week)
- Velocity tracking (commits/week)

### Monthly Monitoring
- GitHub stars growth rate
- Active user count
- Issue/PR activity
- Contributor engagement

### Quarterly Monitoring
