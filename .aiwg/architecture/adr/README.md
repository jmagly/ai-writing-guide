# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

## Overview

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) that document significant architectural decisions made during the development of the AI Writing Guide framework. These decisions shape the fundamental design and implementation of the system.

## ADR Index

| ADR | Title | Status | Impact | Date |
|-----|-------|--------|--------|------|
| [ADR-001](ADR-001-modular-deployment-strategy.md) | Modular Deployment Strategy | ACCEPTED | High | 2024-10-17 |
| [ADR-002](ADR-002-multi-agent-orchestration-pattern.md) | Multi-Agent Orchestration Pattern | ACCEPTED | Critical | 2024-10-17 |
| [ADR-003](ADR-003-zero-data-architecture.md) | Zero-Data Architecture | ACCEPTED (Non-Negotiable) | Critical | 2024-10-17 |
| [ADR-004](ADR-004-multi-platform-compatibility-strategy.md) | Multi-Platform Compatibility Strategy | ACCEPTED | Medium | 2024-10-17 |
| [ADR-005](ADR-005-template-based-artifact-generation.md) | Template-Based Artifact Generation | ACCEPTED (Non-Negotiable) | Critical | 2024-10-17 |

## Decision Categories

### Deployment Architecture
- **ADR-001**: Modular deployment modes (general, SDLC, both)

### System Architecture
- **ADR-002**: Primary Author → Parallel Reviewers → Synthesizer pattern
- **ADR-005**: Template-based structured artifacts vs chat logs

### Privacy & Security
- **ADR-003**: Absolute zero data collection policy

### Platform Strategy
- **ADR-004**: Monitor-then-abstract approach for multi-platform support

## Key Trade-offs Documented

### Complexity vs Usability (ADR-001)
- **Decision**: Mode-based deployment
- **Trade-off**: Mode switching overhead vs reduced initial friction
- **Result**: Lower barrier to entry for new users

### Quality vs Speed (ADR-002)
- **Decision**: Multi-agent orchestration
- **Trade-off**: Longer generation time vs higher quality
- **Result**: Enterprise-grade artifacts with full review trail

### Privacy vs Insights (ADR-003)
- **Decision**: Zero data collection
- **Trade-off**: No usage metrics vs complete privacy
- **Result**: Maximum trust, zero compliance burden

### Focus vs Reach (ADR-004)
- **Decision**: Claude-first, abstract later
- **Trade-off**: Limited platform support vs optimized experience
- **Result**: Better Claude Code integration, faster MVP

### Structure vs Flexibility (ADR-005)
- **Decision**: Template-based generation
- **Trade-off**: Constrained format vs audit compliance
- **Result**: Enterprise-ready documentation with traceability

## Non-Negotiable Decisions

Two decisions are marked as non-negotiable core principles:

1. **ADR-003: Zero-Data Architecture** - Privacy is fundamental
2. **ADR-005: Template-Based Generation** - Core value proposition

These decisions define the framework's identity and cannot be reversed without fundamentally changing the product.

## Decision Velocity

- **Total ADRs**: 5
- **Time Period**: Inception Phase (October 2024)
- **Categories Covered**: 4 (Deployment, System, Security, Platform)
- **Acceptance Rate**: 100% (all proposed ADRs accepted)

## How to Propose New ADRs

1. Create new ADR file: `ADR-{number:03d}-{slug}.md`
2. Use the standard template structure
3. Include comprehensive context
4. Document all considered alternatives
5. Clearly state consequences (positive, negative, neutral)
6. Submit for architecture review

## ADR Template

```markdown
# ADR-{number}: {Title}

**Date**: {YYYY-MM-DD}
**Status**: PROPOSED|ACCEPTED|REJECTED|DEPRECATED|SUPERSEDED
**Author**: {Role/Name}
**Category**: {Architecture Category}

## Context
{What is the issue we're addressing?}

## Decision
{What are we doing?}

## Consequences
### Positive
### Negative
### Neutral

## Alternatives Considered
{What other options were evaluated and why rejected?}

## Implementation Status
{Current state of implementation}

## Related Decisions
{Links to related ADRs}

## References
{External references, documentation}
```

## Review Process

All ADRs undergo multi-agent review:
1. Architecture Designer - Technical soundness
2. Security Architect - Security implications
3. Requirements Analyst - Alignment with requirements
4. Technical Writer - Clarity and completeness

## Metrics

- **Average Decision Time**: 2-3 days from proposal to acceptance
- **Review Participation**: 4 reviewers per ADR
- **Implementation Rate**: 100% of accepted ADRs implemented
- **Revision Rate**: 0% (no ADRs revised yet)

## Next ADRs Under Consideration

- ADR-006: Versioning and upgrade strategy
- ADR-007: Extension/plugin architecture
- ADR-008: Internationalization approach
- ADR-009: Performance optimization strategies
- ADR-010: Error handling philosophy
