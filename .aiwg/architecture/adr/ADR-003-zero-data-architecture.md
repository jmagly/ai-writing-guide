# ADR-003: Zero-Data Architecture

**Date**: 2024-10-17
**Status**: ACCEPTED (Non-Negotiable)
**Author**: Architecture Designer
**Category**: Privacy & Security Architecture

## Context

Modern development tools typically collect extensive telemetry, usage analytics, and user data for product improvement, debugging, and business intelligence. However, this creates significant challenges:

- **Privacy concerns**: Developers increasingly wary of tools that phone home
- **Regulatory complexity**: GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA create compliance burdens
- **Enterprise barriers**: Many organizations prohibit tools that exfiltrate data
- **Trust erosion**: Data breaches have made users skeptical of data collection
- **Maintenance burden**: Solo maintainer cannot handle data security, storage, compliance

The AI Writing Guide must balance the need for adoption metrics with privacy principles and practical maintainability constraints.

## Decision

Implement **absolute zero-data architecture** - never collect, store, or transmit any user data:

**Prohibited completely**:
- ❌ Usage telemetry (no event tracking)
- ❌ Error reporting (no crash reports)
- ❌ User accounts (no authentication)
- ❌ Analytics (no Google Analytics, Mixpanel, etc.)
- ❌ Update checking (no phone-home for versions)
- ❌ License validation (no activation)
- ❌ Feature flags (no remote configuration)
- ❌ A/B testing (no experiments)

**Allowed metrics**:
- ✅ GitHub stars (public, no PII)
- ✅ Fork count (public metric)
- ✅ Issue/PR count (public participation)
- ✅ Download count from GitHub releases (anonymous)

**Implementation**:
- No network calls except user-initiated (git pull for updates)
- No external dependencies that collect data
- No cookies, local storage tracking
- No unique identifiers generated
- Clear documentation of zero-data promise

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Complete privacy**: Users have 100% confidence in privacy
- **Zero compliance burden**: No GDPR/CCPA/HIPAA concerns
- **Enterprise-friendly**: No security review blockers
- **Trust building**: Strong differentiator in market
- **Simplified architecture**: No data pipeline needed
- **No maintenance burden**: No data to secure, store, or manage
- **Offline capable**: Works completely disconnected

### Negative
- **No usage insights**: Cannot know how features are used
- **No error visibility**: Cannot proactively fix issues
- **No adoption metrics**: Only GitHub stars indicate success
- **No personalization**: Cannot tailor experience to user
- **Harder debugging**: Users must manually report issues
- **No feature validation**: Cannot A/B test improvements

### Neutral
- Relies on community feedback vs automated metrics
- Success measured by public engagement (issues, PRs)
- Feature priority based on explicit user requests

## Alternatives Considered

### 1. Opt-in Analytics
**Rejected**: Even optional analytics requires infrastructure, compliance, and erodes trust

### 2. Anonymous Telemetry
**Rejected**: "Anonymous" data often isn't, requires infrastructure, trust issues remain

### 3. Local Analytics Only
**Rejected**: Still creates privacy concerns, users worry about future transmission

### 4. Error Reporting Only
**Rejected**: Slippery slope to more data collection, infrastructure burden

### 5. Self-Hosted Analytics
**Rejected**: Requires user infrastructure, complexity, defeats simplicity goal

## Implementation Status

✅ No analytics code in codebase
✅ No external service integrations
✅ Documentation clearly states zero-data
✅ Install script operates locally only
✅ Updates via explicit git pull only

## Security Considerations

- No attack surface from data collection endpoints
- No stored user data to breach
- No compliance audits required
- No privacy policy needed (no data collected)
- No data retention policies
- No right-to-be-forgotten requests

## Verification

Users can verify zero-data architecture:
1. Check network tab - no external calls
2. Inspect source - no analytics code
3. Run offline - fully functional
4. Audit dependencies - no tracking libraries
