## Usage Guidelines

### When to Create a Card

Create a card for:

- Every campaign (CAM-)
- Every published content piece (CNT-)
- Every creative asset (AST-)
- Every strategic document (STR-)
- Every creative brief (CRE-)
- Every performance report (RPT-)
- Major brand artifacts (BRD-)
- Press/PR materials (PRS-)
- Event materials (EVT-)

### Ownership and Assignment

**Owner**: Single point of accountability for delivery

**Contributors**: Active collaborators who create/edit content

**Reviewers**: Approvers with veto power (brand, legal, stakeholder)

**Team**: Primary functional team (for cross-functional visibility)

**Stakeholders**: Informed parties who provide input but don't approve

### Linking Cards

Use the Related field to create traceability:

- Link content cards (CNT-) to parent campaign (CAM-)
- Link assets (AST-) to content cards (CNT-) and campaigns (CAM-)
- Link reports (RPT-) to campaigns (CAM-) and strategy docs (STR-)
- Link creative briefs (CRE-) to campaigns (CAM-) and assets (AST-)

### Updating Cards

**Status progression**:

1. Draft → In-Progress (work begins)
2. In-Progress → Review (submitted for approval)
3. Review → Approved (cleared for publication)
4. Approved → Published (live)
5. Published → Archived (campaign ended or content retired)

**Date fields**:

- Created: First draft date
- Updated: Last edit date (update frequently)
- Published: Public launch date
- Scheduled: Planned publication date (before publish)

**Performance field**:

- Leave empty until asset is published
- Update post-launch with actual metrics vs targets
- Include in campaign reports (RPT-) for full visibility

## Prefill Automation

Teams can use the `aiwg -prefill-cards` tool to auto-populate metadata from team profiles:

```bash
# Prefill ownership from team-profile.yaml
aiwg -prefill-cards --target /campaigns/cam-001/ --team team-profile.yaml --write

# Example team profile:
# teams:
#   content:
#     owner: Alex Rivera
#     reviewers: [Content Manager, Brand Manager]
#   creative:
#     owner: Jordan Lee
#     reviewers: [Creative Director, Brand Manager]
```

This reduces manual entry and ensures consistency across cards.

## Tools and Integration

**Card tracking tools**:

- `build-artifact-index`: Generate index of all cards by campaign, status, owner
- `check-traceability`: Validate links between campaigns, content, assets, reports
- `project-health-check`: Analyze card metadata for completeness, approval status

**Analytics integration**:

- Link cards to analytics dashboards via Links field
- Track performance in Performance field post-launch
- Generate reports (RPT-) that reference source cards

**Workflow automation**:

- Use Status field to trigger approvals (review → approved)
- Use Dates field to schedule publication
- Use KPIs field to auto-populate analytics dashboards

## Best Practices

1. **Assign owners early**: Every card needs a single owner (no shared ownership)
2. **Update dates frequently**: Keep Updated field current (shows card is active)
3. **Link generously**: Use Related field to connect artifacts (enables traceability)
4. **Set realistic KPIs**: Base targets on historical data, not aspirational guesses
5. **Review compliance early**: Get brand/legal approval before in-progress → review
6. **Archive old cards**: Move completed campaigns to archived status (keeps workspace clean)
7. **Use tags liberally**: Tags enable discovery across campaigns (e.g., find all "product-launch" cards)
8. **Track performance**: Update Performance field post-launch (informs future planning)

## Examples by Template Type

**Campaign Strategy**: CAM-001, links to STR-, CRE-, CNT-, AST-, RPT-

**Blog Post**: CNT-045, links to CAM-, SEO-, AST- (images), SOC- (promotion)

**Social Media Post**: SOC-074, links to CAM-, CNT- (source content), AST- (images/video)

**Email Campaign**: EML-031, links to CAM-, CNT- (content source), AST- (email graphics)

**Video Asset**: AST-112, links to CRE- (brief), CAM-, SOC- (distribution)

**Creative Brief**: CRE-009, links to CAM-, STR-, BRD-, AST- (deliverables)

**Performance Report**: RPT-022, links to CAM-, CNT-, AST-, STR- (original plan)

**Press Release**: PRS-015, links to CAM-, BRD- (brand guidelines), EVT- (if event-related)

**Event Material**: EVT-006, links to CAM-, AST- (slides, booth graphics), PRS- (press kit)

## Migration from Existing Systems

If migrating from existing project management or content systems:

1. **Assign IDs retroactively**: Use creation date or existing ticket numbers
2. **Populate minimum fields**: ID, Owner, Status, Dates, Related (other fields optional initially)
3. **Link incrementally**: Start with campaign-to-content links, expand over time
4. **Import metadata**: Use scripts to extract owner/dates from existing systems
5. **Archive old content**: Mark pre-migration content as archived (focus on active campaigns)
