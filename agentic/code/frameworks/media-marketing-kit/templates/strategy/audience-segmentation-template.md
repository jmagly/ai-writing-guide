## Agent Notes

### For Audience Researcher
- Ground segmentation in both quantitative data (size, value) and qualitative insights (needs, motivations)
- Validate segments through customer interviews, not just internal assumptions

- Use behavioral and needs-based segmentation, not just demographics/firmographics

### For Content Strategist
- Map content to segment-specific pain points and journey stages
- Create segment-specific content calendars to ensure balanced coverage
- Test content performance by segment to validate resonance
- Avoid one-size-fits-all content approaches

### For Campaign Strategist
- Prioritize segments based on strategic fit and economics, not just size
- Allocate budget proportionally to segment priority (80/20 rule often applies)
- Create segment-specific campaign strategies (messaging, channels, offers)
- Monitor segment performance and reallocate resources to highest-performing segments
