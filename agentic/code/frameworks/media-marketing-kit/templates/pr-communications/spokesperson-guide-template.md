- [ ] Email/Slack notifications off
- [ ] Calendar blocked (prevent overlapping meetings)

**Camera Positioning**:

- Head/shoulders visible (not too close, not too far)
- Camera positioned where journalist's face would be (eye contact simulation)

- Soft, diffused light preferred
- Natural skin tones (adjust white balance if needed)

## Core Messages & Talking Points

### Message Architecture

**Primary Message** (The Headline):
```
[One sentence capturing the single most important takeaway]

Example: "Our new AI security platform reduces false alerts by 75%, giving
security teams back 20 hours per week to focus on real threats."
```

**Supporting Messages** (3-5 key points):
```
1. [Message 1 with supporting data]
   - Proof point: [Statistic, customer quote, or case study]
   - Example: [Concrete illustration]

2. [Message 2 with supporting data]
   - Proof point: [Statistic, customer quote, or case study]
   - Example: [Concrete illustration]

3. [Message 3 with supporting data]
   - Proof point: [Statistic, customer quote, or case study]
   - Example: [Concrete illustration]
```

**Message Discipline**:
- Repeat primary message at least 3 times during interview
- Weave supporting messages naturally into answers
- Bridge to messages even when asked off-topic questions
- Use consistent language (don't change terminology mid-interview)

### Soundbite Preparation

**15-Second Soundbites** (TV, Podcast clips):
```
"[Message in 1-2 sentences, quotable, punchy, uses concrete metrics]"

Example: "Security teams waste 80% of their time chasing false alerts.
We've cut that noise by three-quarters, freeing teams to focus on
protecting their companies instead of drowning in meaningless notifications."
```

**Requirements**:
- Complete thought (can stand alone)
- Specific (includes numbers, names, examples)
- Visual language (paints a picture)
- Active voice (dynamic, not passive)
- Quotable (journalist can excerpt verbatim)

**Practice Delivery**:
- Record yourself saying each soundbite
- Time duration (15 seconds max for broadcast)
- Eliminate filler words ("um," "uh," "like," "you know")
- Vary tone (avoid monotone)
- Emphasize key words

## Interview Techniques

### The Bridge Technique

**Formula**: Acknowledge → Bridge → Message

**Examples**:

**Off-topic question**:
Q: "What do you think about [unrelated topic]?"
A: "That's an interesting question. **What I can speak to** is how our
approach to [related topic] addresses [key message]."

**Negative framing**:
Q: "Isn't this just another overhyped AI solution?"
A: "I understand the skepticism - there's been a lot of AI hype. **What makes
our approach different** is [evidence-based message with customer results]."

**Speculation/future**:
Q: "Will you acquire [Company X]?"
A: "We don't comment on rumors or speculation. **What I can tell you** is
our growth strategy focuses on [actual strategic message]."

**Competitor question**:
Q: "How do you compare to [Competitor]?"
A: "I can't speak to their product, but **what I can share** is what makes
our approach unique: [differentiation message]."

### Bridging Phrases

**Acknowledge & Redirect**:
- "That's a fair point. What's important to understand is..."
- "I hear that concern. Let me put it in context..."
- "Good question. What we've found is..."

**Refocus**:
- "What I can speak to is..."
- "What matters most to our customers is..."
- "The key issue here is..."
- "Let's look at the bigger picture..."

**Connect**:
- "That relates to..."
- "Building on that point..."
- "Which brings me back to..."
- "The underlying issue is..."

### Flagging Technique

**Purpose**: Signal important points journalists should note.

**Phrases**:
- "The most important thing to understand is..."
- "The key takeaway here is..."
- "Here's what this really means..."
- "The bottom line is..."
- "What this comes down to is..."

**Usage**: Use sparingly (2-3 times per interview) for primary messages.

### Active Listening

**Before Answering**:
1. Listen to complete question (don't interrupt)
2. Pause (1-2 seconds to collect thoughts)
3. Clarify if unclear ("Just to make sure I understand, you're asking about...")
4. Answer directly first, then expand

**Avoid**:
- Answering before question is complete
- Talking over the journalist
- Ignoring the question entirely
- Long pauses (makes editing difficult)

## Question Preparation

### Anticipated Questions

**Soft Opening Questions** (Expect these first):
```
Q: Can you tell me about [Company/Product] in your own words?
A: [Prepared elevator pitch - 30-60 seconds]

Q: What's new/exciting at [Company]?
A: [Primary message with recent news hook]

Q: What's your background and how did you get into this field?
A: [Brief personal story - 30 seconds - connect to current role]
```

**Core Topic Questions** (Main interview focus):
```
Q: [Specific question about announcement/topic]
A: [Message 1 with proof point and example]

Q: [Follow-up digging deeper into feature/capability]
A: [Supporting message with technical detail as appropriate]

Q: [Customer/market impact question]
A: [Message with customer case study or market data]

Q: [Differentiation/competitive question]
A: [Unique value proposition, avoid naming competitors]
```

**Challenging Questions** (Prepare for difficult topics):
```
Q: [Skeptical question about claim/capability]
A: [Evidence-based response with third-party validation if available]

Q: [Question about limitation or criticism]
A: [Acknowledge honestly, provide context, pivot to strength]

Q: [Comparison to failed/overhyped competitor or approach]
A: [Distance from negative example, focus on your approach and evidence]
```

**Curveball Questions** (Off-topic or unexpected):
```
Q: [Personal opinion on controversial topic]
A: [Bridge to company message or politely decline to comment]

Q: [Speculation about future/unannounced plans]
A: [Don't comment on speculation, focus on what you CAN discuss]

Q: [Request for confidential/proprietary information]
A: [Politely decline, offer alternative information]
```

### Response Frameworks

**STAR Method** (Storytelling):
- **Situation**: Set the scene (customer problem, market gap)
- **Task**: What needed to be done
- **Action**: What you/company did
- **Result**: Specific outcome with metrics

**Example**:
"One of our early customers, a Fortune 500 financial firm, was drowning in
10,000+ security alerts per day. Their team was burned out and missing real
threats. We implemented SecureCloud's AI engine to learn their environment
and filter noise. Within 30 days, they cut alerts by 75% and caught a major
breach attempt they would have missed in the noise. ROI in 6 weeks."

**PEP Method** (Persuasive):
- **Point**: Make your claim
- **Evidence**: Provide proof
- **Point**: Restate for emphasis

**Example**:
"AI can dramatically reduce security team burnout. Our study of 500 security
professionals found 60% experience severe burnout due to alert overload, and
customers using our platform report 80% reduction in stress-related turnover.
When you give teams back their time, you keep your best people."

## What to Avoid

### Red Flags (Never Say)

**Absolutes** (Invite challenge):
- "Never," "Always," "Every," "None"
- "Best in class," "Revolutionary," "Game-changing" (without proof)
- "Obviously," "Clearly" (implies journalist is stupid if they don't agree)

**Speculation**:
- "I think," "I believe," "Maybe," "Probably" (sounds uncertain)
- Future tense without commitment ("We might," "We could")
- Hypotheticals ("If we were to...")

**Negative Language**:
- "No comment" (sounds guilty - instead: "I can't discuss that, but what I can share is...")
- "That's a stupid question" (obvious, but don't insult journalist)
- Repeating negative words from question (reframes positively)

**Jargon & Buzzwords**:
- "Synergy," "Paradigm shift," "Leverage," "Utilize"
- Acronyms without definition (TLA = Three Letter Acronym fatigue)
- Marketing-speak that sounds inauthentic

**Filler Words**:
- "Um," "Uh," "Like," "You know," "So," "Actually"
- Practice eliminating through rehearsal
- Pause silently instead of filling space

### Off-Limits Topics

**Legal/Confidential**:
```
If asked about:
- Pending litigation: "We don't comment on pending legal matters."
- M&A rumors: "We don't speculate on rumors. Our focus is [strategy]."
- Financials (if private): "We're a private company and don't disclose financials."
- Customer names (without permission): "We protect customer confidentiality."
```

**Competitive**:
```
If asked about competitors:
- Don't name them unless already in journalist's question
- Don't disparage ("They're terrible at X")
- Don't speculate about their strategy or financials
- Focus on your differentiation, not their weaknesses

Response: "I can't speak to their approach, but what differentiates us is [message]."
```

**Political/Social Issues** (Unless relevant to business):
```
If asked about controversial topic:
- "I'm here to discuss [topic], not my personal political views."
- "As a company, we focus on [mission]. I'll leave political commentary to others."
- If company has official stance: "Our company's position is [statement]."
```

## Body Language & Vocal Delivery

### Video/In-Person

**Posture**:
- Sit upright (not rigid, natural)
- Slight forward lean (engaged, not bored)
- Shoulders back and down (confident, relaxed)
- Hands visible (on desk or gesturing naturally)

**Eye Contact**:
- In-person: Look at journalist (not camera)
- Video: Look at camera (simulate eye contact with viewers)
- Don't read notes on screen (looks like you're reading)
- Blink naturally (don't stare unnervingly)

**Facial Expression**:
- Smile when appropriate (warm, approachable)
- Match expression to content (serious topics = serious face)
- Avoid frozen expression (animate naturally)
- React to journalist (nod, acknowledge points)

**Gestures**:
- Natural hand movements (emphasize points)
- Keep hands in "power zone" (chest to waist height)
- Avoid repetitive movements (distracting)
- Open palms (trustworthy, honest)
- Avoid fidgeting (pen clicking, hair touching)

**Clothing**:
- Solid colors (avoid busy patterns on video)
- Professional attire (match brand and context)
- Avoid noisy jewelry (bracelets that clank)
- Test on camera beforehand (some colors/patterns cause issues)

### Vocal Delivery

**Pace**:
- Speak at conversational pace (not too fast, not too slow)
- Pause between thoughts (allows journalist to process)
- Slow down for key points (emphasis)
- Vary pace (monotone is boring)

**Volume**:
- Project confidence (not too quiet)
- Don't shout (even if passionate)
- Consistent volume (not trailing off at sentence end)

**Tone**:
- Warmth and enthusiasm (especially for phone/podcast)
- Match emotion to content (excited for good news, serious for challenges)
- Avoid defensive or aggressive tone (even with tough questions)
- Smile while talking (improves vocal tone even on phone)

**Clarity**:
- Enunciate clearly (don't mumble)
- Pronounce names/terms correctly (practice beforehand)

- Open mouth when speaking (not talking through closed teeth)

## Phone Interview Specifics

**Preparation**:
- [ ] Quiet location (no background noise)
- [ ] Landline or strong cell signal (not spotty connection)
- [ ] Water nearby (avoid dry mouth)
- [ ] Notes/talking points visible (they can't see you reading)
- [ ] Stand or sit upright (improves vocal projection)

**Techniques**:
- **Smile while talking** (improves tone, sounds more engaging)
- **Gesture naturally** (even though they can't see you - improves energy)
- **Pause before answering** (allows you to collect thoughts, slows pace)
- **Repeat journalist's name occasionally** ("That's a great question, Sarah...")
- **Avoid speakerphone** (unless necessary - reduces audio quality)

**Pitfalls to Avoid**:
- Eating, drinking, chewing gum (audible)
- Typing (if taking notes, use pen and paper)
- Rustling papers near microphone
- Putting journalist on hold (mute instead if necessary)
- Answering other calls/messages during interview

## Podcast Interview Specifics

**Format Differences**:
- Longer format (30-90 minutes typical)
- Conversational (less formal than news interview)
- Storytelling encouraged (personal anecdotes, behind-the-scenes)
- Listener context (may not know company - explain more)

**Preparation**:
- Listen to 2-3 recent episodes (understand host style, format, audience)
- Prepare stories (not just facts - engaging narratives)
- Think visually (describe scenarios listeners can imagine)
- Prepare questions for host (often interactive)

**Delivery**:
- More animated (voice needs to carry without video)
- Longer answers (30-60 seconds, not 15-second soundbites)
- Natural conversation flow (less scripted than TV interview)
- Show personality (podcast audiences want authenticity)

**Technical**:
- High-quality microphone (podcast hosts notice bad audio)
- Headphones (prevents echo/feedback)
- Quiet room (podcasts are audio-only - noise is very distracting)

## Live TV/Broadcast Specifics

**High-Pressure Environment**:
- Can't edit mistakes (everything is live)
- Time constraints (strict segment lengths)
- Competition for attention (other guests, breaking news)
- Visual scrutiny (appearance matters more)

**Preparation**:
- Makeup (even for men - reduces shine under bright lights)
- Wardrobe (solid colors, avoid white and busy patterns)
- Multiple outfit options (ask producer for guidance)
- Arrive early (30+ minutes for hair/makeup/mic check)

**Techniques**:
- **Shorter answers** (30-45 seconds max)
- **Soundbite first** (lead with most quotable line)
- **Look at host, not camera** (unless told otherwise)
- **Stay engaged during others' comments** (camera may be on you)
- **Don't touch microphone or IFB earpiece** (distracting)

**Crisis Scenarios**:
- **Breaking news pre-empts segment**: Gracious, offer to reschedule
- **Aggressive host/ambush**: Stay calm, bridge to messages
- **Technical difficulties**: Wait patiently, smile, stay professional
- **Time cut short**: Deliver primary message concisely

## Crisis Interview Scenarios

### Handling Negative Questions

**Acknowledge → Provide Context → Move Forward**:
```
Q: "Your product had a major security breach last month. How can customers trust you?"

A: "You're right that we experienced an incident, and I want to be transparent
about what happened and what we've done to address it. [Brief factual
explanation]. We immediately [actions taken], and we've implemented
[preventive measures] to ensure this doesn't happen again. What I can tell
you is that [evidence of improvement/customer confidence]. We took this
seriously, learned from it, and are stronger as a result."
```

**Never**:
- "No comment" (sounds guilty)
- Blame others (customers, partners, vendors)
- Minimize ("It wasn't that bad")
- Get defensive or angry
- Speculate about cause if still under investigation

### Handling "Gotcha" Questions

**Stay Calm, Don't Take Bait**:
```
Q: "Your competitor says your technology is outdated. How do you respond?"

A: "I haven't seen that comment, so I can't respond to it directly. What I
can tell you is that our customers consistently choose us because [evidence-based
differentiation]. The proof is in results: [customer metrics and outcomes]."
```

**Bridge Away from Trap**:
- Acknowledge without repeating negative
- Provide factual counter-evidence
- Refocus on your strengths
- Don't insult or name competitor

### Handling "I Don't Know"

**Be Honest, Then Bridge**:
```
"That's not my area of expertise. What I can speak to is [related topic
where you have authority]. If you'd like detailed information on [original
question], I can connect you with [appropriate expert/resource]."
```

**Never**:
- Make something up (will be fact-checked)
- Fake knowledge you don't have
- Say "I don't know" and leave it there (offer to find answer)
