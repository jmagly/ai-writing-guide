## Content Sections

### Headline Guidelines

**Strong Headlines** (High Media Pickup):
- Lead with the news: "[Company] Launches [Product]"
- Include numbers: "[Company] Raises $50M Series B"
- Active verbs: "Unveils," "Announces," "Partners," "Expands"
- Location/market: "[Company] Expands to European Market"
- Benefit-focused: "[Product] Reduces Energy Costs by 40%"

**Weak Headlines** (Avoid):
- Vague: "[Company] Makes Important Announcement"
- Passive voice: "New Product Released by [Company]"
- Jargon-heavy: "[Company] Revolutionizes Synergistic Solutions"
- Clickbait: "You Won't Believe What [Company] Just Did"
- Too long: Headlines exceeding 100 characters

### Lead Paragraph Formula

```
[Company], [descriptor], [time marker] [action verb] [subject].
[Impact/significance in one sentence with metric if available].
```

**Example**:
"Acme Corp, a leading provider of cloud security solutions, today announced the launch of SecureCloud 3.0, its next-generation threat detection platform. The new release reduces false positives by 75% compared to previous versions, enabling security teams to focus on genuine threats."

### Quote Integration

**Executive Quote Best Practices**:
- First quote at paragraph 3-4 (after lead and supporting details)
- Include full name and title on first mention
- Provide strategic context, not facts (facts go in body text)
- Forward-looking or customer-benefit focused
- 50-100 words optimal
- Use conversational language (avoid corporate speak)

**Quote Attribution**:
- First mention: "Full Name, Title at Company"
- Subsequent: "Name" or "he/she/they said"
- Multiple quotes: Alternate between execs, customers, partners

**Quote Examples**:

Strong:
> "Our customers told us they spend too much time chasing false alerts. SecureCloud 3.0's AI-powered engine learns from their environment to surface only the threats that matter, giving teams back 20 hours per week to focus on strategic security initiatives."

Weak:
> "We are excited to announce SecureCloud 3.0, which leverages cutting-edge AI to revolutionize the cybersecurity landscape with best-in-class threat detection."

### Boilerplate Text

**Company Description Components**:
1. Company name and industry positioning
2. Core products/services (2-3 bullets)
3. Key differentiator or mission
4. Relevant metrics (customers served, markets, employees)
5. Headquarters location and founding year

**Length Variations**:
- **Short** (25 words): For brief releases, email signatures
- **Medium** (50 words): Standard press release boilerplate
- **Long** (100 words): Detailed backgrounders, feature articles

**Example (50 words)**:
"Acme Corp is a cloud security platform protecting 10,000+ enterprises across 50 countries. Founded in 2015 and headquartered in San Francisco, Acme combines AI-powered threat detection with zero-trust architecture to reduce security incidents by an average of 60%. Learn more at acmecorp.com."
