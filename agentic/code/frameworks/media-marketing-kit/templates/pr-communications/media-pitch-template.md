## Pitch Templates by Type

### 1. Product Launch Pitch

```
Subject: Exclusive: AI security tool cuts false alerts 75% (data inside)

Hi [Name],

Given your recent coverage of security team burnout in [Publication], I wanted
to share data that directly ties into that challenge.

[Company] just launched SecureCloud 3.0, an AI-powered threat detection platform
that reduces false positive alerts by 75% in production environments. Early
customers (including Fortune 500 firms) are saving 20+ hours per week on alert
triage - time previously lost to chasing false alarms.

We've been tracking the "alert fatigue" problem for 18 months through surveys
of 500+ security professionals. The full dataset shows 68% of teams receive
10,000+ alerts daily, with 92% being false positives. I can share the complete
study exclusively with [Publication] ahead of public release.

Would you be interested in:
- Early access to the research data and methodology?
- Interview with our CEO on the human cost of alert overload?
- Demo of the AI engine with a customer case study?

I'm available to discuss by phone at [number] or can send materials via email
if you prefer. Happy to work on your timeline.

Best regards,
[Name]

### 2. Executive Interview/Thought Leadership

```
Subject: CISO with 20 yrs exp available to discuss breach response lessons

Hi [Name],

I saw your piece on [Article Title] and thought you might be looking for
additional expert perspectives on post-breach recovery strategies.

Our CEO, [Name], has 20 years of experience responding to major security
incidents at Fortune 100 companies (including [notable example if public]).
She recently published research on why 80% of breach response plans fail
in the first 24 hours - primarily due to communication breakdowns, not
technical issues.

[Name] has insights on:
- The 3 most common mistakes in the first hour after detection
- Why executive teams underestimate communication overhead (data from 50 breaches)
- How to structure incident response for distributed/remote teams

She's available for a 30-minute phone or video interview this week or next,
and I can provide supporting data and customer anonymized case studies if
helpful for your story.

Would Thursday or Friday afternoon work for a brief conversation?

Best regards,
[Your Name]

### 3. Data/Research Study Pitch

```
Subject: Data: 60% of security teams burned out (exclusive study)

Hi [Name],

I have exclusive data that supports the trend you've been covering on
security professional burnout and retention challenges.

Our survey of 1,200 security practitioners across enterprise organizations
found:
- 60% report moderate to severe burnout symptoms
- 73% cite "alert overload" as the primary cause
- 45% actively looking for new roles (up from 28% last year)

This data hasn't been published yet. I can offer [Publication] exclusive
first coverage with full methodology, demographic breakdowns, and anonymized
quotes from survey participants.

The study also includes comparative data from 2022 and 2023, showing the
burnout trend accelerating significantly this year.

Would this be a good fit for [specific section/column]? I can send the
full report under embargo for [date] if you're interested.

Happy to discuss by phone: [number]

### 4. Partnership/Collaboration Announcement

```
Subject: [Company A] + [Company B] partnership: Joint AI ethics framework

Hi [Name],

[Company A] and [Company B] are announcing a partnership tomorrow that
addresses a gap in AI governance you covered in your recent article
on [Topic].

The two companies are jointly developing an open-source AI ethics
framework specifically for healthcare applications - the first cross-
industry initiative focused on this vertical.

What makes this newsworthy:
- First joint framework (competitors collaborating on standards)
- Focus on healthcare (higher stakes than general AI ethics)
- Open-source (free for any organization to adopt)
- Includes enforcement mechanisms (not just principles)

I can offer:
- Embargo access to the announcement (goes public [Day] at [Time])
- Joint interview with both CEOs
- Early preview of the framework documentation
- Customer pilot data (3 health systems already testing)

Are you interested in covering this? I need to confirm by EOD [Day] for
embargo access.

### 5. Funding Round/Milestone Announcement

```
Subject: [Company] raises $50M Series B for AI security platform

Hi [Name],

[Company] just closed a $50M Series B round led by [Investor] to expand
our AI-powered security platform into the European market.

This might be of interest given your coverage of cybersecurity funding
trends and the recent slowdown in late-stage rounds. A few data points:

- 10x revenue growth in 18 months (from $5M to $50M ARR)
- 500+ enterprise customers including [notable names if public]
- Expanding to London, Paris, Frankfurt in Q1 2025
- Planning 200 new hires (mostly engineering)

What makes this round notable:
- Oversubscribed (turned down additional $20M)
- International expansion focus (EU data residency requirements driving demand)
- Counter-trend to broader slowdown in enterprise software funding

Available for interview:
- CEO [Name] on market opportunity and expansion plans
- Lead investor [Name] from [VC Firm] on why they invested now

Would this fit your funding round coverage? I can provide additional metrics
and customer testimonials if helpful.

Subject: [CEO Name] keynoting [Conference] on AI regulation - interview opp

Hi [Name],

Our CEO, [Name], is keynoting [Conference Name] next week (Tuesday, [Date])
on the topic of AI regulation and industry self-governance.

Given your recent reporting on the [Regulatory Topic], I thought you might

a contrarian view on [Specific Angle] that challenges the conventional wisdom
in the industry.

Key talking points:
- Why current AI regulation proposals miss the mark (specific critiques)

### 7. Customer Success Story Pitch

```
Subject: How [Customer] cut security costs 40% (case study available)

Hi [Name],

I have a customer story that illustrates the ROI challenge you discussed
in your article on [Topic].

[Customer Company], a [Industry] firm with [Size], reduced security
operations costs by 40% while improving threat detection accuracy using
[Product]. The CISO is willing to go on record with specific metrics and
lessons learned from the implementation.

Key data points:
- $2M annual savings (reduced headcount needs by 15 FTEs)
- 75% reduction in mean time to respond (4 hours → 60 minutes)
- 99.8% threat detection accuracy (up from 87%)
- 6-month ROI (faster than expected)

This might resonate with your audience given the current pressure on
security budgets and the debate over AI effectiveness in real-world
environments.

Would you be interested in interviewing [CISO Name] from [Customer]?
I can facilitate the introduction and provide supporting documentation
(contract and technical details with customer approval).

Available this week or next based on your timeline.
