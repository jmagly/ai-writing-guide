## Purpose

Comprehensive playbook for identifying, managing, and communicating during crisis situations that threaten company reputation, operations, customer trust, or employee safety. Provides decision trees, escalation protocols, communication templates, and recovery procedures optimized for speed, accuracy, and stakeholder protection.

## Crisis Definition & Severity Levels

### What Constitutes a Crisis

A crisis is an unexpected event or situation that:
- Threatens company reputation or brand
- Impacts customer data, privacy, or safety
- Disrupts core business operations
- Violates legal or regulatory requirements
- Creates significant media attention (negative)
- Affects employee safety or well-being
- Threatens financial stability or investor confidence

### Severity Levels

#### Level 1: Minor Incident
**Definition**: Isolated issue with limited scope and impact
**Examples**:
- Service outage affecting < 10% of customers for < 1 hour
- Minor security vulnerability (low severity, quickly patched)
- Negative social media post from single customer
- Isolated product defect affecting < 100 units

**Response**:
- Handled by functional teams (support, engineering, product)
- PR informed but not lead
- Standard communication channels
- Resolution timeline: Hours to 1 day

**Escalation**: If impacts grow or media inquiries received

---

#### Level 2: Moderate Crisis
**Definition**: Significant issue requiring cross-functional coordination
**Examples**:
- Service outage affecting 10-50% of customers for 1-4 hours
- Data breach affecting < 1,000 customers (PII exposed)
- Executive departure under negative circumstances
- Product recall affecting thousands of units
- Regulatory inquiry or investigation
- Negative tier 2/3 media coverage

**Response**:
- PR leads communication + Legal + Functional lead
- Crisis response team activated (virtual)
- Holding statement within 2 hours
- Full statement within 24 hours
- Customer notification (if applicable)
- Resolution timeline: 1-7 days

**Escalation**: If national media picks up, customer impact worsens, or legal exposure increases

---

#### Level 3: Major Crisis
**Definition**: Severe incident with enterprise-wide impact
**Examples**:
- Major service outage (> 50% customers, > 4 hours)
- Large-scale data breach (> 1,000 customers, sensitive data)
- Security incident affecting core systems
- Tier 1 national media coverage (negative)
- Product defect causing injury or significant damage
- Executive misconduct allegations

- Holding statement within 1 hour
- Full statement within 4-6 hours
- Customer notification immediately
- Media monitoring 24/7
- Legal and regulatory notifications
- Board informed within 2 hours
- Resolution timeline: 1-4 weeks

**Escalation**: Automatic board notification, potential outside counsel/crisis PR firm

---

#### Level 4: Catastrophic Crisis
**Definition**: Existential threat to company survival
**Examples**:
- Massive data breach (entire customer base compromised)
- Complete service outage (days, not hours)
- Product defect causing fatalities
- Criminal investigation of company or executives
- Cyberattack crippling operations (ransomware)
- Environmental disaster (if physical operations)
- Widespread employee safety incident

**Response**:
- CEO + Board chair lead
- Full crisis team + Outside crisis management firm

## First 60 Minutes: Immediate Response

- [ ] Establish secure communication channel
- [ ] Document timeline (start incident log)

**Key Questions**:

- Who is affected? (customers, employees, systems)
- What is current status? (ongoing, contained, resolved)
- What are immediate safety/security concerns?

**Incident Log Template**:
```
Crisis ID: [YYYY-MM-DD-###]
Severity Level: [1/2/3/4]
Detected: [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM TZ]
Reported By: [Name, Role]
Initial Description: [2-3 sentence factual summary]

Timeline:

```

### Minute 15-30: Containment & Notification

**Actions**:
- [ ] Initiate technical/operational containment
- [ ] Identify stakeholder notification requirements:
  - Customers (if data/service affected)
  - Employees (if safety/operations affected)
  - Board (Level 3/4 automatic, Level 2 if material)
  - Regulators (if legal requirement - GDPR, SEC, etc.)
  - Law enforcement (if criminal activity suspected)

```

### Minute 30-60: Communication Planning

  - Partners/vendors (if affected)
  - Investors (if material impact)
- [ ] Draft customer notification (if applicable)
- [ ] Prepare FAQ for support team

**Decision: Proactive vs Reactive Media**:

**Stay Reactive If**:
- Limited scope (contained quickly)
