## Purpose

Your brand story is the narrative foundation that makes your company human, memorable, and relatable. It's not a timeline of milestones—it's the **why** behind your brand: the problem you experienced, the insight you had, and the change you're creating.

Use this story across founder interviews, About pages, pitch decks, keynote talks, and any moment where you need to connect emotionally with your audience.

## Story Framework

A compelling brand story follows this arc:

1. **The World Before** (Setup): What was broken? What frustrated you?
2. **The Catalyst** (Inciting Incident): What specific moment made you realize something had to change?
3. **The Insight** (Turning Point): What did you realize that others missed?
4. **The Solution** (Action): What did you build? How is it different?
5. **The Impact** (Transformation): What's changing because you exist?
6. **The Future** (Vision): Where is this heading?

---

## 1. Origin Story (Founder Narrative)

### 1.1 The World Before (Setup)

**The Problem You Experienced**:

[Describe the specific pain point or frustration that led to starting the company. Make it personal and relatable. Use "I" or "we" (founder voice).]

**Example**:

"I spent five years as an engineering manager at a hypergrowth startup. My team was talented, motivated, and distributed across four time zones. But we were drowning in meetings—status updates, planning sessions, retrospectives. I watched engineers context-switch six times a day, losing flow state every time someone said, 'Got 5 minutes for a quick sync?'

The tools didn't help. Slack created constant interruption. Email buried decisions. Project management software became a graveyard of outdated tasks. We were moving fast but feeling chaotic."

**Your World Before**:

[Write your founder's experience with the problem. 2-3 paragraphs. Make it vivid and specific.]

### 1.2 The Catalyst (Inciting Incident)

**The Moment Everything Changed**:

[What was the specific event or realization that made you decide to solve this? This is the "I have to do something about this" moment.]

**Example**:

"The breaking point came during a sprint retro. One of my best engineers said, 'I feel like I'm managing up more than I'm coding. Half my day is explaining what I already documented somewhere.'

I looked at the Slack transcript from that week: 847 messages in our main channel. I checked our meeting calendar: 18 hours of scheduled calls for a team of 8. We were communicating *constantly* but collaborating *poorly*. The tools were the problem—not the people."

**Your Catalyst**:

[Write the specific moment or realization. 1-2 paragraphs. This should be emotionally resonant—frustration, anger, or a lightbulb moment.]

### 1.3 The Insight (Turning Point)

**What You Realized That Others Missed**:

[What was your unique perspective or insight? What did you understand about the problem that existing solutions didn't?]

**Example**:

"Here's what I realized: **Synchronous collaboration is optimized for urgency, not importance.** Chat and meetings assume everyone's available *right now*—but great work requires deep focus, which means being *unavailable*.

The best teams I'd worked with didn't communicate more—they communicated *better*. They documented decisions. They gave context. They let people work in their own flow, then aligned asynchronously. But no tool was built for that workflow. Everything assumed real-time was better than async."

**Your Insight**:

[Write your unique realization. What's the non-obvious truth you discovered? 1-2 paragraphs.]

### 1.4 The Solution (What You Built)

**How You Decided to Solve It**:

[Transition from insight to action. Why did you decide to build a company around this? What made you think you could solve it?]

**Example**:

"I started prototyping a tool that worked the way my best teams worked: async-first. Instead of asking 'Who's online?', it asked 'What decision needs to be made?' Instead of threading every message, it structured conversations around outcomes. Instead of notifications by default, it surfaced what mattered when you were ready to engage.

I showed it to my team. Then to friends at other companies. The response was immediate: 'When can I use this? This is how I *wish* we worked.'"

**Your Solution**:

[Write how you went from insight to building. 2-3 paragraphs. Include early validation or customer feedback if applicable.]

### 1.5 The Impact (What's Changing)

**The Transformation You're Creating**:

[What's different now because your company exists? How are customers' lives or work better? Use specific examples or customer stories.]

**Example**:

"Today, over 2,000 teams use [Product] to work async-first. Engineering teams cut meeting time by 40%. Product teams make decisions 3x faster. Remote teams stay aligned without burning out.

But the impact goes beyond productivity metrics. We're hearing from customers that they have time for deep work again. That they're setting boundaries without feeling guilty. That junior team members contribute ideas they would've never spoken up about in a meeting.

We're changing what 'good collaboration' means—from 'always available' to 'purposefully engaged.'"

**Your Impact**:

[Write about the change you're creating. Use customer stories, quotes, or metrics. 2-3 paragraphs.]

### 1.6 The Future (Where This Is Going)

**The Vision You're Building Toward**:

[What's the long-term change you're working toward? What does the world look like in 5-10 years if you succeed?]

**Example**:

"This is just the beginning. We're building toward a future where work adapts to humans—not the other way around. Where 'collaboration' doesn't mean 'constant availability.' Where distributed teams are *more* effective than co-located ones—not despite the distance, but because of the intentionality it requires.

If we succeed, the 9-to-5 synchronous workday will feel as outdated as the fax machine. Teams will work in flow, not in meetings. And 'I need to focus' will be a celebrated boundary, not a career risk."

**Your Vision**:

[Write your aspirational future. What changes if you succeed? 1-2 paragraphs.]

## 2. Story Variations by Length

### 2.1 The 30-Second Version (Elevator Pitch)

**Use Case**: Networking events, casual introductions, quick pitches

**Structure**: Problem → Solution → Impact (3 sentences)

**Example**:

"I started [Company] because I was tired of spending 20 hours a week in meetings that could've been documents. We built an async collaboration platform that helps distributed teams make decisions without the constant interruptions of Slack or Zoom. Now over 2,000 teams use us to cut meeting time by 40% while improving decision quality."

**Your 30-Second Story**:

[Write your 3-sentence version]

### 2.2 The 2-Minute Version (Podcast/Interview Intro)

**Use Case**: Podcast guest intros, panel discussions, media interviews

**Structure**: Setup → Catalyst → Insight → Solution → Impact (5-7 sentences)

**Example**:

"I spent five years managing engineering teams at a hypergrowth startup, and I watched talented people drown in meetings and Slack messages. The breaking point came when one of my best engineers told me he spent more time explaining his work than actually doing it—we were communicating constantly but collaborating poorly.

I realized the problem wasn't the people—it was the tools. Everything assumed real-time collaboration was best, but great work requires deep focus, which means being unavailable. So I built [Product], an async-first platform that structures collaboration around decisions, not chat threads.

Today, over 2,000 distributed teams use us to cut meeting time by 40% while making better decisions faster. We're proving that async-first doesn't mean slow—it means intentional. And that's how you build sustainable, high-performing teams."

## 3. Brand Story by Stakeholder

### 3.1 For Customers (Relatability Focus)

**Emphasis**: Shared pain point, "You're not alone," customer success

**Tone**: Empathetic, validating, solution-focused

**Example Opening**:

"If you've ever felt like you're spending more time in meetings than doing actual work, you're not alone. We started [Company] because we lived that frustration—watching talented teams lose hours to status updates and 'quick syncs' that derailed their focus.

We built [Product] to work the way great teams actually work: async-first, decision-focused, and respectful of deep work time. Today, teams like yours use us to reclaim 8+ hours a week while staying more aligned than ever."

**Your Customer Story**:

[Write your customer-focused version, 2-3 paragraphs]

### 3.2 For Investors (Vision Focus)

**Emphasis**: Market opportunity, unique insight, traction, long-term vision

**Tone**: Confident, data-informed, ambitious

**Example Opening**:

"The future of work is async-first, but the tools haven't caught up. 70% of knowledge workers are now distributed, yet collaboration software still assumes everyone's in the same room (or Zoom call) at the same time. This creates a $50B productivity gap—talented teams hamstrung by constant interruptions.

We started [Company] because I experienced this firsthand managing distributed engineering teams. I realized the problem wasn't remote work—it was synchronous tools forcing async teams into real-time constraints. We built the first collaboration platform optimized for async workflows: structured decision-making, automatic context capture, and intelligent prioritization.

We're at $XM ARR with 2,000 teams, growing 15% month-over-month. Our NPS is 68, and customers report 40% reduction in meeting time within 30 days. This isn't a feature—it's a category. We're redefining what 'collaboration' means for the distributed work era."

**Your Investor Story**:

[Write your investor-focused version, 3-4 paragraphs with metrics and market context]

### 3.3 For Employees (Mission Focus)

**Emphasis**: Why the work matters, impact on customers, culture and values

**Tone**: Inspiring, inclusive, purpose-driven

**Example Opening**:

"We're not just building software—we're changing how millions of people work. Every feature we ship gives someone back an hour they would've spent in a pointless meeting. Every decision thread we improve helps a team make smarter choices faster. Every notification we eliminate protects someone's focus.

I started [Company] because I was tired of watching great people burn out from constant interruptions disguised as 'collaboration.' I wanted to build a company where the product respects people's time—and the culture does too. Where async-first isn't just a feature, it's how we work.

That's what you're building here. Tools that let people do their best work without sacrificing their boundaries. A company that proves you can be high-performing without being always-on. If that mission resonates with you, we'd love to have you on the team."

**Your Employee Story**:

[Write your employee-focused version, 2-3 paragraphs emphasizing mission and values]

### 3.4 For Media/Press (Newsworthiness Focus)

**Emphasis**: Contrarian insight, market timing, what's new/different

**Tone**: Provocative, trend-aware, quotable

**Example Opening**:

"Everyone's talking about the future of remote work, but they're solving the wrong problem. The issue isn't *where* people work—it's *when*. Synchronous tools like Slack and Zoom assume everyone's available at the same time, which creates the 'always-on' culture burning out distributed teams.

We're flipping that assumption. [Company] is the first collaboration platform built for async-first workflows—structured decision-making that doesn't require everyone to be online simultaneously. Since launching 18 months ago, we've grown to 2,000 customers who've collectively eliminated over 500,000 meeting hours.

The trend is clear: async isn't a workaround for remote teams—it's the unlock. And the companies that figure this out first will win the war for talent."

**Your Media Story**:

**2. Burnout hit crisis levels.** The 'always-on' culture of Slack and Zoom created pandemic Zoom fatigue. Workers are demanding boundaries. Companies that respect async workflows will win the talent war.

**3. AI made async scalable.** Capturing context and surfacing insights used to require manual effort. Now AI can auto-summarize decisions, extract action items, and prioritize what matters. Async collaboration is finally as frictionless as real-time—without the interruption cost."
