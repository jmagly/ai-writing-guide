## Purpose

Elevator pitches are concise, compelling summaries of your company designed for different contexts and time constraints. This template provides multiple pitch variations (30s, 60s, 2min) optimized for networking, investor meetings, sales calls, and media opportunities.

## Pitch Framework

All effective elevator pitches follow this structure:

1. **Hook**: Grab attention (problem or surprising statement)
2. **What You Do**: Clear description in simple terms
3. **How It Works**: Brief mechanism or differentiator
4. **Proof/Traction**: Credibility signal (metric, customer, achievement)
5. **CTA**: What you want the listener to do next

---

## 1. The 30-Second Pitch (Networking)

**Use Case**: Networking events, conference hallway conversations, quick introductions

**Structure**: Hook → What → Proof (3 sentences max)

**Word Count**: 50-75 words

**Delivery Time**: 30 seconds at natural speaking pace

### 1.1 Template

```
[Hook: Problem or surprising fact]
[What you do + how it's different]
[Proof point + CTA]
```

### 1.2 Example (B2B SaaS)

"Most distributed teams spend 20+ hours a week in meetings that could've been emails. We built an async collaboration platform that structures work around decisions—not chat threads or video calls. We've helped 2,000 teams cut meeting time by 40% in the first month. We should talk if you manage remote teams."

### 1.3 Example (Consumer App)

"75% of people abandon their workout routines within 6 weeks—not because they're lazy, but because generic plans don't fit their lives. Our app builds adaptive workout plans that adjust daily based on your energy, schedule, and goals. We've got 100k active users with 3x better retention than Peloton. I'd love to show you."

### 1.4 Example (Hardware/Physical Product)

"Single-use plastic bottles are killing the planet, but reusable bottles are annoying to carry and clean. We created a collapsible, self-sanitizing water bottle that fits in your pocket when empty. We sold 50,000 units in our first year and we're stocked in 200 REI stores. Let me show you one."

### 1.5 Your 30-Second Pitch

**Hook** (Problem or surprising fact):

[Write your attention-grabbing opening sentence]

**What You Do** (Solution + differentiation):

[Explain what you do and how you're different, 1 sentence]

**Proof + CTA** (Credibility + next step):

[Share traction metric and suggest next step, 1 sentence]

**Full 30-Second Pitch** (Assembled):

[Combine all three elements into 50-75 words]

---

## 2. The 60-Second Pitch (Formal Introduction)

**Use Case**: Investor intros, panel discussions, podcast guest introductions, formal networking

**Structure**: Hook → What → How → Proof → CTA (5 sentences)

**Word Count**: 100-150 words

**Delivery Time**: 60 seconds

### 2.1 Template

```
[Hook: Problem or market opportunity]
[What you do: Solution description]
[How it works: Key differentiator or mechanism]
[Proof: Traction, customers, metrics, or team credibility]
[CTA: What happens next]
```

### 2.2 Example (B2B SaaS)

"Distributed teams waste 40% of their time in synchronous meetings—status updates, planning sessions, retrospectives. It's the biggest productivity drain in remote work, costing companies billions in lost focus time.

We're [Company], an async-first collaboration platform. Instead of defaulting to meetings, we structure work around decision threads—clear problem statements, stakeholder input, and documented outcomes. Think GitHub pull requests, but for every business decision.

We launched 18 months ago and now serve 2,000 companies including [Notable Customer 1] and [Notable Customer 2]. Teams reduce meeting time by 40% within 30 days while improving decision quality—our NPS is 68.

If you're leading remote teams or investing in future-of-work tools, I'd love to show you a demo and share our growth metrics."

### 2.3 Example (Consumer/Marketplace)

"1 in 3 Americans struggles with chronic pain, but finding the right physical therapist is a nightmare—4-week wait times, insurance headaches, and generic treatment plans.

We're [Company], a virtual PT marketplace. We match patients with licensed physical therapists in under 24 hours, accept 200+ insurance plans, and use AI to build personalized treatment programs. Sessions are video-based, so you can do PT from home.

We've served 15,000 patients in 12 months, with 92% satisfaction and 40% faster recovery times than in-person PT. We're backed by [Investor] and growing 20% month-over-month.

If you've experienced PT frustration—or know someone who has—try a free consultation. I'd also love to connect you with our head of clinical outcomes."

### 2.4 Example (Hardware Startup)

"The restaurant industry wastes $55 billion in food annually—not because chefs are careless, but because inventory management is stuck in the 1990s. Walk into any restaurant kitchen and you'll see clipboards and spreadsheets.

We're [Company], and we built smart sensors that track food freshness in real-time. Our IoT devices sit in fridges, detect temperature fluctuations and aging patterns, then alert staff before food spoils. It integrates with existing POS systems—no behavior change required.

We're in 200 restaurants across 5 states. Early customers reduced waste by 30% in the first quarter, which saved them an average of $18,000 annually. We just closed a $3M seed round led by [Investor].

If you're in food service or interested in IoT sustainability plays, I'd love to schedule a kitchen demo."

### 2.5 Your 60-Second Pitch

**Hook** (Problem or market opportunity):

[Write your opening 1-2 sentences establishing the problem or gap]

**What You Do** (Solution description):

[Explain your solution, 1-2 sentences]

**How It Works** (Key differentiator or mechanism):

[Describe what makes you different or unique approach, 1-2 sentences]

**Proof** (Traction, customers, metrics):

[Share credibility signals: numbers, customers, growth, funding, 1-2 sentences]

**CTA** (What happens next):

[Suggest next step or action, 1 sentence]

**Full 60-Second Pitch** (Assembled):

[Combine all elements into 100-150 words]

---

## 3. The 2-Minute Pitch (Investor Meeting)

**Use Case**: Investor meetings, pitch competitions, detailed sales calls, media interviews

**Structure**: Hook → Problem → Solution → Market → Traction → Team → Ask (7-10 sentences)

**Word Count**: 250-350 words

**Delivery Time**: 2 minutes

### 3.1 Template

```
[Hook: Attention-grabbing statement or question]
[Problem: The pain point, with scale/scope]
[Why Now: Market timing or recent shift]
[Solution: What you built and how it works]
[Differentiation: How you're better/different than alternatives]
[Traction: Metrics, customers, growth rate]
[Team: Why you're the right people to build this]
[Ask/CTA: Funding amount, partnership, sale, next step]
```

### 3.2 Example (Investor Pitch - B2B SaaS)

"What if I told you that the average knowledge worker spends 23 hours per week in meetings—but only considers 37% of them productive? That's 14.5 wasted hours per person, per week.

The problem is synchronous collaboration tools. Slack, Zoom, and Teams all assume everyone's available at the same time. But great work requires deep focus, which means being unavailable. This creates the 'always-on' culture that's burning out distributed teams. It's a $50 billion productivity gap.

The shift to remote work made this urgent. 70% of knowledge workers are now distributed, yet we're still using tools designed for co-located teams. Companies are hemorrhaging talent because of meeting overload.

We're [Company], the first async-first collaboration platform. Instead of chat or video calls, we structure work around decision threads: clear problem statements, stakeholder input, and documented outcomes. AI automatically summarizes discussions, extracts action items, and notifies people when decisions are made—not when messages are sent.

Unlike project management tools, we're built for conversations, not tasks. Unlike Slack, we're built for decisions, not chatter. We eliminate 90% of notification noise while improving decision speed.

We launched 18 months ago and now serve 2,000 companies including [Notable Customer 1], [Customer 2], and [Customer 3]. We're at $2M ARR, growing 15% month-over-month. Our net revenue retention is 130%—customers expand because they see immediate ROI. NPS is 68. Average customer cuts meeting time by 40% in the first 30 days.

My co-founder and I spent a combined 10 years managing distributed engineering teams at [Previous Companies]. We lived this pain and built the tool we wished existed.

We're raising a $5M Series A to expand our go-to-market and double down on AI-powered decision intelligence. We'd love to partner with investors who understand the future of work. Can we schedule a deep-dive next week?"

### 3.3 Example (Investor Pitch - Consumer Health)

"Chronic pain affects 100 million Americans—more than diabetes, heart disease, and cancer combined. Yet the average wait to see a physical therapist is 4 weeks. By the time you get an appointment, you've been living with pain for a month.

The problem is supply: there are only 250,000 licensed PTs in the US, mostly concentrated in cities. Rural areas are underserved. And even if you find a PT, insurance is a nightmare—copays, pre-authorizations, out-of-network headaches. So people suffer, self-medicate, or end up in surgery that could've been prevented.

Telehealth changed everything. Video visits work great for PT—you don't need hands-on manipulation for 80% of treatments. But the PT industry hasn't caught up. Existing players like Hinge Health are B2B2C, which means 6-month sales cycles. We went direct-to-consumer.

We're [Company], a virtual PT marketplace. We match patients with licensed PTs in under 24 hours, accept 200+ insurance plans, and use AI to build personalized treatment programs. Sessions are video-based—you do PT from your living room. Our average session cost is $40 with insurance, $89 without—half the price of in-person.

We're different from digital health apps because we have real, licensed clinicians. We're different from traditional PT because we're accessible and affordable. And we're different from B2B telehealth because we acquire customers directly—our CAC is $120 vs. industry average of $800.

We've served 15,000 patients in 12 months. We're at $1.8M revenue run rate, growing 20% MoM. Patient satisfaction is 92%, and clinical outcomes beat in-person PT: 40% faster recovery on average. Our retention is 65% at 6 months.

I'm a former physical therapist who got frustrated with the system. My co-founder built telehealth infrastructure at [Previous Company]. We're backed by [Angel Investors] and just closed a $1.2M seed.

We're raising a $4M Series A to expand to all 50 states and build our AI treatment plan engine. We're looking for investors with healthcare experience who can open doors to health system partnerships. What questions can I answer?"

## 4. Pitch Variations by Audience

### 4.1 Customer/Sales Pitch

**Focus**: Customer pain point → Your solution → ROI/outcomes

**Tone**: Consultative, benefit-focused, proof-driven

**CTA**: Demo, trial, case study

**Example** (60 seconds):

"If your team is spending 15+ hours a week in status meetings, you're not alone—it's the #1 complaint we hear from distributed teams. The problem isn't lack of communication; it's the wrong tools. Slack and Zoom force real-time interaction, which interrupts deep work.

We built [Product] to fix this. Instead of chat, we structure work around decision threads—async discussions with clear outcomes. Your team stays aligned without constant meetings. AI summarizes threads and surfaces what matters when you're ready to engage.

Our customers cut meeting time by 40% in the first month while improving decision speed by 3x. [Customer Name] went from 18 hours of weekly meetings to 10—and their team engagement scores went up 25%.

I'd love to show you a 15-minute demo and share how teams like yours are using it. Does next Tuesday work?"

**Your Customer Pitch** (60 seconds):

[Write your customer-focused pitch emphasizing pain → solution → ROI]

### 4.2 Investor Pitch (Traction-Heavy)

**Focus**: Market size → Your growth → Why you'll win → Ask

**Tone**: Confident, data-driven, ambitious

**CTA**: Funding round, follow-up meeting

**Example** (60 seconds):

"We're building the async-first collaboration platform for the $50B future-of-work market. Distributed teams are the norm—70% of knowledge workers are remote—but tools still assume real-time availability. That's our wedge.

We launched 18 months ago and we're at $2M ARR, growing 15% MoM. Net revenue retention is 130%. We have 2,000 customers including [Notable Names]. Our sales cycle is 14 days—half the industry average—because the pain is acute.

We're raising $5M to scale GTM and build AI decision intelligence. We have $800k committed from [Lead Investor]. We'd love your participation—especially if you can intro us to future-of-work portfolio companies. Can we send our deck?"

**Your Investor Pitch** (60 seconds):

[Write your investor-focused pitch emphasizing market, traction, ask]

### 4.3 Media/Press Pitch

**Focus**: Newsworthy angle → Contrarian insight → What's changing

**Tone**: Provocative, trend-aware, quotable

**CTA**: Interview, feature, story angle

**Example** (60 seconds):

"Everyone's talking about the future of remote work, but they're solving the wrong problem. The issue isn't *where* people work—it's *when*. Synchronous tools like Slack assume everyone's available simultaneously, which creates the 'always-on' burnout plaguing distributed teams.

We're [Company], and we're flipping that assumption. We built the first async-first collaboration platform—structured decision-making that doesn't require real-time availability. Since launching 18 months ago, our 2,000 customers have collectively eliminated over 500,000 meeting hours.

The trend is clear: async isn't a workaround—it's the unlock. And the companies figuring this out first will win the talent war. I'd love to share our data on meeting fatigue and show you how teams are using async to reclaim deep work time."

**Your Media Pitch** (60 seconds):

[Write your media-focused pitch with strong hook and contrarian angle]

### 4.4 Partnership Pitch

**Focus**: Mutual benefit → Integration/collaboration opportunity → Success metrics

**Tone**: Collaborative, strategic, win-win

**CTA**: Partnership meeting, integration discussion

**Example** (60 seconds):

"Your customers use [Partner Product] to manage projects, but they're still drowning in meetings to discuss those projects. That's where we come in.

[Our Product] integrates with [Partner Product] to structure async decision-making. When a task needs input, it creates a decision thread in our platform—stakeholders contribute async, AI summarizes, and the outcome syncs back to [Partner] automatically. Your customers get aligned faster without meeting overload.

We've already built a beta integration that 50 mutual customers are using. They're seeing 30% faster task completion. I'd love to explore a formal partnership—potentially co-marketing or a bundled offering. Can we set up a call with your partnerships team?"

**Your Partnership Pitch** (60 seconds):

[Write your partnership-focused pitch emphasizing mutual value]

- Slow down for important numbers/proof points

**Eye Contact**:
- In-person: Maintain eye contact 60-70% of time

- Smile when appropriate (especially at hook and CTA)

### 5.2 Written Delivery (Email Pitch)

**Subject Line**: [Benefit or curiosity gap, 40-60 characters]

**Example Subject Lines**:
- "Cut your team's meeting time by 40%"
- "How [Customer Name] eliminated status meetings"
- "Quick question about [Recipient's Company]'s remote workflow"

**Email Body Structure**:

```
Hi [Name],

[Personalized opening: mention mutual connection, recent news, or specific pain point]

[30s pitch: Hook → What → Proof]

[CTA: Specific, low-friction ask]

Best,
[Your Name]
[Title]
[Contact Info]
```

**Example**:

```
Subject: How Acme Corp cut meeting time by 45%

Hi Sarah,

I saw your LinkedIn post about meeting overload on your distributed team—sounds brutal. Your comment about "spending more time talking about work than doing work" really resonated.

Most distributed teams waste 20+ hours/week in synchronous meetings. We built an async collaboration platform that structures work around decisions, not chat threads. Companies like Acme Corp use us to cut meeting time by 40% while improving decision quality.

Would you be open to a 15-min demo? I'd love to show you how teams in [Industry] are using it. Here's my Calendly: [link]

Best,
Alex
```

### 5.3 Common Mistakes to Avoid

**Don't**:
- ✗ Use jargon or acronyms without explanation
- ✗ Rush through your pitch (you'll sound nervous)
- ✗ Lead with "We're an AI-powered platform that..." (too generic)
- ✗ Make unverifiable claims ("We're the best," "Revolutionary")
- ✗ Forget to ask for something (always have a CTA)
- ✗ Go over time (respect the format: 30s means 30s)
- ✗ Read from notes/slides (memorize or internalize key points)
- ✗ Undersell traction ("We're just starting..." sounds weak)

**Do**:
- ✓ Start with a hook (surprising fact, relatable problem)
- ✓ Use specific numbers (not "lots of customers" but "2,000 customers")
- ✓ Make it conversational (not a rehearsed script)
- ✓ Tailor to your audience (investor vs. customer pitch differs)
- ✓ End with a clear CTA ("Can we schedule a demo for Tuesday?")
- ✓ Practice out loud (10+ times until natural)
- ✓ Record yourself and watch/listen back

---

## 7. Pitch Testing & Iteration

### 7.1 A/B Test Your Hooks

Try 3 different opening hooks and track which gets best response:

| Hook Variant | Context Tested | Response Rate | Winner? |
|--------------|----------------|---------------|---------|
| "Most teams waste 20 hours/week in meetings..." | Networking event | [Track interest level] | [ ] |
| "What if I told you your team could cut meeting time by 40%..." | Email outreach | [Track reply rate] | [ ] |
| "The average knowledge worker spends 23 hours/week in meetings..." | Investor intro | [Track follow-up requests] | [ ] |

### 7.2 Gather Feedback

After delivering pitch, ask:
- "What questions do you have?" (reveals what wasn't clear)
- "What resonated most with you?" (reveals strongest elements)
- "How would you explain this to a colleague?" (tests clarity)

### 7.3 Iterate Based on Data

**Track Metrics**:
- Conversion rate (pitch → meeting/demo/investment interest)
- Most common questions (indicates gaps in pitch)
- Time to close after pitch (shorter = clearer value prop)

**Update Quarterly**:
- Refresh numbers (customers, revenue, traction)
- Test new hooks based on feedback
- Adjust differentiation based on competitive landscape
