**Pronouns**:

### 4.3 AI Content Guidelines

- No clear perspective or opinions

**Authenticity Markers to Add**:
- Specific examples from real experience
- Clear opinions ("We believe," "In our experience")
- Acknowledgment of trade-offs ("This approach works best when X, but if Y, consider Z")
- Conversational asides (parentheticals, em-dashes)
- Varied sentence structure (mix short and long)
- Domain-appropriate jargon used naturally
