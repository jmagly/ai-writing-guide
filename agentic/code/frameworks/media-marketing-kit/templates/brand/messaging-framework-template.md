## 10. Messaging Do's and Don'ts

### Do's

- ✓ Lead with customer benefit, not product feature
- ✓ Use specific numbers ("save 8 hours/week" not "save time")
- ✓ Show, don't tell ("85% adoption rate" not "highly adopted")
- ✓ Use active voice ("We help teams collaborate" not "Collaboration is enabled")
- ✓ Front-load key message (first sentence = most important)
- ✓ Match audience sophistication (technical for engineers, business ROI for execs)
- ✓ Provide proof for every claim
- ✓ Make claims defensible (avoid "best," "revolutionary" without proof)

### Don'ts

- ✗ Use jargon without context ("synergistic paradigm shift")
- ✗ Make unverifiable claims ("world's best," "everyone loves")
- ✗ Lead with features ("We have 47 integrations")
- ✗ Sound like everyone else ("streamline workflows," "empower teams" without specifics)
- ✗ Overcomplicate ("Our proprietary algorithm leverages ML to optimize...")
- ✗ Use passive voice ("Productivity is increased by our platform")
- ✗ Bury the headline (get to the point in sentence 1, not paragraph 3)
- ✗ Forget the "so what?" test (always answer "why should customer care?")
