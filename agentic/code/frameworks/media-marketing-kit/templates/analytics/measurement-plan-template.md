## 5. Attribution Model

### 5.1 Attribution Approach

**Primary Attribution Model**: [e.g., "Data-Driven Attribution (Google Analytics 4)"]

**Why this model**:

- [Rationale 1 - e.g., "Machine learning distributes credit based on actual conversion paths"]
- [Rationale 2 - e.g., "Works in cookieless environment using modeled data"]
- [Rationale 3 - e.g., "Supported natively in GA4 for cross-channel view"]

**Secondary Attribution Models** (for comparison):

- [Model 2 - e.g., "First-Touch Attribution (for awareness measurement)"]
- [Model 3 - e.g., "Last-Touch Non-Direct (for demand gen validation)"]

**Attribution Windows**:

- **Click-through window**: [e.g., "30 days"]
- **View-through window**: [e.g., "7 days for display/video ads"]
- **Rationale**: [Why these windows - e.g., "Average sales cycle is 45 days, so 30-day click + 7-day view captures majority of influence"]

### 5.2 Attribution Challenges & Solutions

| **Offline conversions** | [CRM integration, call tracking with UTM passthrough, offline conversion import] |

### 5.3 Attribution Reporting

**Attribution Report Cadence**: [e.g., "Monthly detailed analysis, quarterly deep-dive"]

**Key Attribution Questions**:

- Which channels drive the most conversions? (Last-touch)
- Which channels initiate customer journeys? (First-touch)
- Which channels assist conversions? (Multi-touch contribution)
- What is the typical customer journey? (Path analysis)
- Which combinations of channels perform best? (Channel interaction)

**Attribution Outputs**:

- [Path analysis report - visualize common conversion paths]
- [Channel contribution report - credit distribution across channels]
- [Assisted conversion analysis - identify supporting channels]
- [Time lag analysis - understand sales cycle by channel]

|-----------|---------|--------|---------|
| `utm_source` | Traffic source | [Platform name] | `google`, `linkedin`, `newsletter` |
| `utm_medium` | Marketing medium | [Channel category] | `cpc`, `social`, `email`, `organic` |
| `utm_campaign` | Campaign name | [Campaign ID or descriptor] | `q1-product-launch`, `webinar-2025-02` |
| `utm_content` | Ad/content variant | [Creative version] | `headline-a`, `cta-button-red`, `video-30s` |
| `utm_term` | Keyword (paid search) | [Keyword or audience] | `enterprise-software`, `{keyword}` (dynamic) |

**Custom Parameters** (optional, for advanced tracking):

- `utm_id`: [Campaign ID for GA4 campaign grouping]
- `utm_source_platform`: [Differentiate platform vs partner - e.g., "linkedin" vs "linkedin_sponsored"]

**Naming Conventions**:

- **Always lowercase**: [utm_source=linkedin, not LinkedIn]
- **Use hyphens, not underscores**: [q1-product-launch, not q1_product_launch]
- **Be consistent**: [Use "cpc" for all paid search, not mix of "cpc", "ppc", "paid-search"]
- **Avoid special characters**: [No spaces, no &, no =]

**UTM Builder Tool**: [Link to internal UTM builder or standardized spreadsheet]

### 6.3 Conversion Tracking

**Conversion Events**:

| Conversion Event | Trigger | Tracking Method | Value | Destination |
|------------------|---------|-----------------|-------|-------------|

## 9. Incrementality Testing

### 9.1 Purpose

Incrementality testing validates whether marketing channels truly drive incremental conversions (not just claiming credit for users who would have converted anyway).

**Key Questions**:

- Does this channel actually drive new conversions, or just reach existing intent?
- What happens if we turn off this channel for a period?
- How much lift does this campaign provide vs. no campaign?

### 9.2 Testing Methodology

**Geo-based Holdout Test**:

- **Approach**: [Run campaign in Treatment markets, withhold from Control markets]
- **Example**: ["Run paid search in 80% of markets, exclude 20% as control"]
- **Measurement**: [Compare conversion rates in Treatment vs Control markets]
- **Incrementality calculation**: [(Treatment conversions - Control conversions) / Control conversions]

**Time-based Holdout Test**:

- **Approach**: [Run campaign for 2 weeks, pause for 1 week, measure delta]
- **Example**: ["Pause LinkedIn ads for 1 week per month, measure impact on MQLs"]
- **Measurement**: [Compare conversion rates during on-weeks vs off-weeks]

**User-level Randomized Test** (PSA approach):

- **Approach**: [Show campaign to Treatment group, show PSA to Control group]
- **Example**: ["Meta Conversion Lift Study - show ad to 90%, PSA to 10%"]
- **Measurement**: [Compare conversion rates between Treatment and Control cohorts]

### 9.3 Test Design

**Sample Test Plan**:

- **Channel**: [e.g., "Paid Social (Meta)"]
- **Hypothesis**: ["Paid social drives 200 incremental MQLs per month"]
- **Test type**: [Geo-holdout or platform conversion lift study]
- **Treatment**: [Run ads in selected markets]
- **Control**: [Exclude ads from control markets or show PSA]
- **Duration**: [4 weeks minimum for statistical significance]
- **Success criteria**: [>10% lift in Treatment vs Control]

**Statistical Rigor**:

- **Minimum sample size**: [Use power analysis - typically need 1000+ conversions for 95% confidence]
- **Significance level**: [95% confidence, p < 0.05]
- **Test duration**: [Long enough to cover full sales cycle - at least 2x average conversion window]

### 9.4 Incrementality Reporting

**Test Results Template**:

| Metric | Control | Treatment | Lift | Significance |
|--------|---------|-----------|------|--------------|
| [Impressions] | [N/A] | [500,000] | [N/A] | [N/A] |
| [Conversions] | [150] | [195] | [+30%] | [p = 0.02, significant] |
| [Conversion rate] | [2.5%] | [3.3%] | [+0.8pp] | [Significant] |
| [Cost per incremental conversion] | [N/A] | [$45 / (195-150) = $222] | [N/A] | [N/A] |

**Interpretation**: [Based on this test, paid social drives 45 incremental conversions (195 - 150), representing a 30% lift. The cost per incremental conversion is $222, which is within target CAC of $250.]
