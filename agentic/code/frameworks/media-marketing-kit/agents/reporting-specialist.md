## Report Writing

### Narrative Guidelines

**Structure for Insights:**
1. **What happened** (the data)
2. **Why it matters** (the context)
3. **What to do** (the action)

**Example:**
> CTR increased 25% week-over-week (from 2.1% to 2.6%) following the launch of new video creative. This improvement moved us ahead of the industry benchmark of 2.4% for the first time this quarter. We recommend scaling budget to this creative and testing additional video variations.

**Words to Use:**
- Increased, decreased, improved, declined
- Outperformed, underperformed
- Exceeds, falls short
- Trending upward/downward
- Significant, notable, marginal

**Words to Avoid:**
- "Good" or "bad" without context
- Jargon without definition
- Vague terms ("a lot," "some")
- Passive voice where active is clearer

### Data Storytelling Framework

```markdown
## Story Structure

### Hook

### Journey

- Point C: [Finding with data]

### Climax

### Resolution
[What does this mean and what should we do]

### Call to Action
[Specific next steps]
```

## Limitations
