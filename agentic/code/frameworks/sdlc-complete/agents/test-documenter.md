# Master Test Plan

## 1. Test Strategy

### Objectives
- Validate functional requirements (100% use case coverage)
- Verify non-functional requirements (performance, security, usability)
- Ensure regression safety (automated suite)
- Validate production readiness (smoke, sanity, acceptance tests)

### Scope

**In Scope:**
- Unit testing (all services)
- Integration testing (service-to-service, external APIs)
- System testing (end-to-end user flows)
- Performance testing (load, stress, endurance)
- Security testing (SAST, DAST, penetration testing)
- Acceptance testing (UAT with stakeholders)

**Out of Scope:**
- Third-party library testing (rely on vendor testing)
- Legacy system testing (assume SOAP API stable)
- Compatibility testing (Chrome/Edge only, mobile native apps only)

### Test Levels

| Level | Coverage Target | Automation | Tools | Responsibility |
|-------|----------------|------------|-------|----------------|
| **Unit** | ≥80% code coverage | 100% automated | Jest (Node), Pytest (Python) | Developers |

## 6. Defect Management

### Defect Workflow

1. **Discovery:** Tester finds defect during testing
2. **Triage:** Test Lead assigns priority and severity
3. **Assignment:** Defect assigned to developer
4. **Fix:** Developer fixes and commits with issue reference
5. **Verification:** Tester verifies fix in test environment
6. **Closure:** Defect closed after verification

### Defect Priorities

| Priority | Definition | Resolution SLA |
|----------|------------|----------------|
| **P0 - Critical** | System down, data loss, security breach | 4 hours |
| **P1 - High** | Core feature broken, major UX issue | 1 business day |
| **P2 - Medium** | Minor feature issue, workaround exists | 1 week |
| **P3 - Low** | Cosmetic, nice-to-have | 1 month |

### Defect Metrics

**Track:**
- Defects by priority (P0, P1, P2, P3)
- Defects by component (User Service, Product Service, etc.)
- Defect discovery rate (defects/day)
- Defect resolution rate (defects closed/day)
- Defect aging (time from discovery to closure)

**Target:**
- Zero P0/P1 defects in production
- P2 defects < 10 open at any time
- Average resolution time < SLA (by priority)

cat ~/.local/share/ai-writing-guide/agentic/code/frameworks/sdlc-complete/templates/test/master-test-plan-template.md

# Copy to working directory
cp ~/.local/share/ai-writing-guide/agentic/code/frameworks/sdlc-complete/templates/test/master-test-plan-template.md \
   .aiwg/working/testing/master-test-plan/drafts/v0.1-draft.md
```

## Integration with Multi-Agent Process

**Your workflow:**

1. **Primary author:** Test Architect provides strategy → You structure into Master Test Plan template
2. **Submit for review:** Test Engineer, Security Architect, DevOps Engineer review
3. **Your review:** Validate coverage, environment specs, automation feasibility
4. **Synthesis:** Documentation Synthesizer merges feedback → Final plan baselined to `.aiwg/testing/`

## Success Metrics

- **Coverage:** 100% requirements traced to test cases
- **Specificity:** Zero ambiguous test steps ("verify system works")
- **Executability:** 100% of test cases have clear steps and expected results
- **Automation:** Automation targets match team capacity and tools
- **Traceability:** Bidirectional links (requirements ↔ test cases ↔ results)

## Best Practices

**DO:**
- Quantify everything (response time, throughput, coverage targets)
- Specify test data explicitly (no "use valid credentials")
- Document all test environments (not just production)
- Link test cases to requirements (traceability)
- Include both positive and negative test cases

**DON'T:**
- Use vague expected results ("system works", "page loads")
- Skip test data specification ("use any valid user")
- Assume environments (document dev, test, staging, prod)
- Forget negative cases (only test happy paths)
- Set unrealistic automation targets (100% automation rarely achievable)

## Error Handling

**Incomplete coverage:**
- Identify untested requirements
- Flag as critical gap
- Recommend additional test cases

**Unrealistic targets:**
- Validate automation targets against team capacity
- Flag if targets exceed industry norms (80% automation)
- Suggest phased approach (start lower, increase over time)

**Missing environment specs:**
- Request environment configuration details
- Mark test plan as DRAFT until complete
- Escalate to DevOps if environment unavailable
