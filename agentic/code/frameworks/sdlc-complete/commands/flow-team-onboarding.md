## Common Failure Modes

### Access Delays
**Symptoms**: New member cannot access critical systems on day 1
**Remediation**:
1. Escalate to Operations Liaison immediately
2. Provide temporary workarounds (read-only access, pair with buddy)
3. Document delay and root cause
4. Adjust onboarding timeline if significant delay

### Overwhelming Information
**Symptoms**: New member struggling to absorb material, asks same questions repeatedly
**Remediation**:
1. Slow down pace, reduce training density
2. Provide written documentation for reference
3. Increase buddy pairing time
4. Break complex topics into smaller chunks

### Buddy Unavailability
**Symptoms**: Buddy too busy to provide adequate support
**Remediation**:
1. Escalate to Project Manager
2. Assign backup buddy or rotate buddy duties
3. Reduce buddy's other commitments
4. Adjust new member's expectations and timeline

### Mismatched Expectations
**Symptoms**: New member expected different role, responsibilities, or tech stack
**Remediation**:
1. Clarify role and responsibilities immediately
2. If mismatch is significant, escalate to leadership
3. Adjust onboarding plan to bridge gaps
4. Consider role change if fundamental mismatch

### Slow Ramp-Up
**Symptoms**: Not meeting 30/60/90 day milestones
**Remediation**:
1. Conduct early intervention check-in
2. Identify specific skill gaps or blockers
3. Provide targeted training or mentorship
4. Extend onboarding timeline if needed
5. Document reasons for slower ramp-up

## Integration with Team Roster

Update team roster with onboarding status:

```bash
# Add new team member to roster
/project:update-roster add \
  --name "{name}" \
  --role "{role}" \
  --start-date "{date}" \
  --status "onboarding"

# Update onboarding progress
/project:update-roster update \
  --name "{name}" \
  --onboarding-phase "{week-1 | month-2 | month-3}"

# Mark onboarding complete
/project:update-roster update \
  --name "{name}" \
  --status "active" \
  --onboarding-complete true
```

## Documentation Requirements

Maintain the following onboarding documents:

1. **Pre-Boarding Checklist**: Track access, equipment, documentation
2. **Onboarding Plan**: Personalized plan with training schedule
3. **Buddy Assignment**: Buddy responsibilities and pairing schedule
4. **Starter Tasks**: Sequenced tasks with acceptance criteria
5. **Check-In Notes**: 30/60/90 day check-in summaries
6. **Feedback Log**: Continuous feedback on onboarding process

## Handoff to Regular Operations

At 90 days (or when onboarding complete):

1. Remove "onboarding" status from team roster
2. Transition buddy relationship to peer relationship
3. Include in regular performance review cycle
4. Consider as mentor for future onboardees
5. Archive onboarding materials for process improvement
