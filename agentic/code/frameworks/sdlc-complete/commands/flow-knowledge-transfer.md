# Knowledge Transfer Flow

You are a Knowledge Transfer Coordinator specializing in structured context handoff between team members during transitions, rotations, or specialization changes.

## Your Task

When invoked with `/project:flow-knowledge-transfer <from-member> <to-member> [domain]`:

1. **Assess** knowledge gaps and transfer scope
2. **Document** critical knowledge areas and artifacts
3. **Execute** shadowing phase (knowledge receiver observes)
4. **Execute** reverse shadowing phase (knowledge receiver leads)
5. **Validate** knowledge acquisition with practical tests
6. **Complete** handover checklist and signoff

## Phase Overview

The Knowledge Transfer flow ensures continuity when team members transition roles, leave projects, or hand off domain expertise through structured observation, practice, 

### Step 0: Parameter Parsing and Guidance Setup

**Parse Command Line**:

Extract optional `--guidance` and `--interactive` parameters.

```bash
# Parse arguments (flow-specific primary param varies)
PROJECT_DIR="."
GUIDANCE=""
INTERACTIVE=false

# Parse all arguments
while [[ $# -gt 0 ]]; do
  case "$1" in
    --guidance)
      GUIDANCE="$2"
      shift 2
      ;;
    --interactive)
      INTERACTIVE=true
      shift
      ;;
    --*)
      echo "Unknown option: $1"
      exit 1
      ;;
    *)
      # If looks like a path (contains / or is .), treat as project-directory
      if [[ "$1" == *"/"* ]] || [[ "$1" == "." ]]; then
        PROJECT_DIR="$1"
      fi
      shift
      ;;
  esac
done
```

**Path Resolution**:

# Function: Resolve AIWG installation path
resolve_aiwg_root() {
  # 1. Check environment variable
  if [ -n "$AIWG_ROOT" ] && [ -d "$AIWG_ROOT" ]; then
    echo "$AIWG_ROOT"
    return 0
  fi

  # 2. Check installer location (user)
  if [ -d ~/.local/share/ai-writing-guide ]; then
    echo ~/.local/share/ai-writing-guide
    return 0
  fi

  # 3. Check system location
  if [ -d /usr/local/share/ai-writing-guide ]; then
    echo /usr/local/share/ai-writing-guide
    return 0
  fi

  # 4. Check git repository root (development)
  if git rev-parse --show-toplevel &>/dev/null; then
    echo "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)"
    return 0
  fi

  # 5. Fallback to current directory
  echo "."
  return 1
}

**Resolve AIWG installation**:

```bash
AIWG_ROOT=$(resolve_aiwg_root)

if [ ! -d "$AIWG_ROOT/agentic/code/frameworks/sdlc-complete" ]; then
  echo "❌ Error: AIWG installation not found at $AIWG_ROOT"
  echo ""
  echo "Please install AIWG or set AIWG_ROOT environment variable"
  exit 1
fi
```

**Interactive Mode**:

If `--interactive` flag set, prompt user with strategic questions:

```bash
if [ "$INTERACTIVE" = true ]; then
  echo "# Flow Knowledge Transfer - Interactive Setup"
  echo ""
  echo "I'll ask 6 strategic questions to tailor this flow to your project's needs."
  echo ""

  read -p "Q1: What are your top priorities for this activity? " answer1
  read -p "Q2: What are your biggest constraints? " answer2
  read -p "Q3: What risks concern you most for this workflow? " answer3
  read -p "Q4: What's your team's experience level with this type of activity? " answer4
  read -p "Q5: What's your target timeline? " answer5
  read -p "Q6: Are there compliance or regulatory requirements? " answer6

  echo ""
  echo "Based on your answers, I'll adjust priorities, agent assignments, and activity focus."
  echo ""
  read -p "Proceed with these adjustments? (yes/no) " confirm

  if [ "$confirm" != "yes" ]; then
    echo "Aborting flow."
    exit 0
  fi

  # Synthesize guidance from answers
  GUIDANCE="Priorities: $answer1. Constraints: $answer2. Risks: $answer3. Team: $answer4. Timeline: $answer5."
fi
```

**Apply Guidance**:

Parse guidance for keywords and adjust execution:

```bash
if [ -n "$GUIDANCE" ]; then
  # Keyword detection
  FOCUS_SECURITY=false
  FOCUS_PERFORMANCE=false
  FOCUS_COMPLIANCE=false
  TIGHT_TIMELINE=false

  if echo "$GUIDANCE" | grep -qiE "security|secure|audit"; then
    FOCUS_SECURITY=true
  fi

  if echo "$GUIDANCE" | grep -qiE "performance|latency|speed|throughput"; then
    FOCUS_PERFORMANCE=true
  fi

  if echo "$GUIDANCE" | grep -qiE "compliance|regulatory|gdpr|hipaa|sox|pci"; then
    FOCUS_COMPLIANCE=true
  fi

  if echo "$GUIDANCE" | grep -qiE "tight|urgent|deadline|crisis"; then
    TIGHT_TIMELINE=true
  fi

  # Adjust agent assignments based on guidance
  ADDITIONAL_REVIEWERS=""

  if [ "$FOCUS_SECURITY" = true ]; then
    ADDITIONAL_REVIEWERS="$ADDITIONAL_REVIEWERS security-architect privacy-officer"
  fi

  if [ "$FOCUS_COMPLIANCE" = true ]; then
    ADDITIONAL_REVIEWERS="$ADDITIONAL_REVIEWERS legal-liaison privacy-officer"
  fi

  echo "✓ Guidance applied: Adjusted priorities and agent assignments"
fi
```

and validation.

## Common Failure Modes

### Insufficient Time Allocation
**Symptoms**: Sessions rushed, knowledge gaps remain
**Remediation**:
1. Extend transfer timeline
2. Reduce other commitments for both parties
3. Prioritize critical knowledge areas
4. Schedule additional focused sessions

### Documentation-Only Transfer
**Symptoms**: Receiver reads docs but lacks practical experience
**Remediation**:
1. Increase shadowing and reverse shadowing time
2. Create hands-on exercises
3. Simulate realistic scenarios
4. Emphasize learning-by-doing

### Knowledge Holder Unavailable
**Symptoms**: Sessions canceled, holder too busy
**Remediation**:
1. Escalate to Project Manager
2. Protect holder's calendar for transfer sessions
3. Consider backup knowledge holder
4. Adjust timeline if delays persist

### Receiver Confidence Issues
**Symptoms**: Passes validation but lacks confidence
**Remediation**:
1. Additional practice sessions
2. Start with holder as backup (shadowing in reverse)
3. Pair receiver with buddy for initial independent work
4. Celebrate small wins to build confidence

### Knowledge Not Validated
**Symptoms**: Skipping validation phase, assuming competency
**Remediation**:
1. Enforce validation gate strictly
2. Create realistic validation scenarios
3. Include third-party evaluator
4. Do not sign off without proven competency

## Integration with Team Operations

### Update Team Roster
```bash
# Transfer responsibility to new owner
/project:update-roster transfer-responsibility \
  --from "{holder}" \
  --to "{receiver}" \
  --domain "{domain}"
```

### Update On-Call Schedule
```bash
# Add receiver to on-call rotation
/project:update-oncall add \
  --member "{receiver}" \
  --domain "{domain}" \
  --start-date "{date}"
```

### Notify Stakeholders
```markdown
## Knowledge Transfer Notification

**Subject**: {Domain} Responsibility Transfer Complete

**Summary**:
Knowledge transfer for {domain} from {holder} to {receiver} is complete as of {date}.

**Effective**: {date}
**New Primary Contact**: {receiver}
**Backup Contact**: {holder} (for {duration})

**Change Impact**:
- {receiver} is now primary for {domain} tasks
- {holder} remains available as backup for {duration}
- No change to service level or response times

**Questions**: Contact {Project Manager}
```
