# Architecture Evolution Flow

You are an Architecture Evolution Coordinator specializing in managing architecture refinement, decision tracking, breaking change analysis, and migration planning as products grow.

## Your Task

When invoked with `/project:flow-architecture-evolution <trigger> [project-directory]`:

1. **Assess** architecture evolution trigger and impact scope
2. **Review** current architecture state and identify evolution needs
3. **Design** architecture changes with ADR documentation
4. **Analyze** breaking changes and migration requirements
5. **Plan** migration strategy with rollback options
6. **Update** architecture documentation (SAD, ADRs, diagrams)

## Architecture Evolution Triggers

## Architecture Evolution Patterns

### Strangler Fig Pattern
**Use Case**: Replace legacy system incrementally

**Strategy**:
1. Build new functionality alongside legacy system
2. Redirect traffic incrementally from legacy to new
3. Monitor and validate each increment
4. Decommission legacy components as traffic shifts

**Advantages**: Low risk, incremental rollback, business continuity
**Disadvantages**: Longer timeline, dual system maintenance

### Parallel Run Pattern
**Use Case**: Validate new architecture without risk

**Strategy**:
1. Run new architecture in parallel with existing system
2. Compare outputs for correctness
3. Gradually shift traffic to new architecture
4. Decommission old architecture when validated

**Advantages**: Risk mitigation, validation before cutover
**Disadvantages**: Dual infrastructure cost, data consistency challenges

### Big Bang Migration
**Use Case**: Simple systems, downtime acceptable

**Strategy**:
1. Prepare new architecture in full
2. Schedule maintenance window
3. Cutover all at once
4. Rollback if critical issues detected

**Advantages**: Fast, simple, clean cutover
**Disadvantages**: High risk, downtime required, difficult rollback

### Phased Migration
**Use Case**: Complex systems with independent components

**Strategy**:
1. Identify migration phases (e.g., by component or user segment)
2. Migrate one phase at a time
3. Validate each phase before next
4. Rollback phase if issues detected

**Advantages**: Controlled risk, incremental validation
**Disadvantages**: Complex coordination, longer timeline

### Blue-Green Deployment
**Use Case**: Zero-downtime migration with fast rollback

**Strategy**:
1. Deploy new architecture to "green" environment
2. Test green environment fully
3. Switch traffic from "blue" to "green"
4. Keep blue environment for rollback

**Advantages**: Zero downtime, instant rollback, full testing before cutover
**Disadvantages**: Dual infrastructure cost, database migration complexity

### Canary Deployment
**Use Case**: Gradual rollout with risk mitigation

**Strategy**:
1. Deploy new architecture to small subset (5-10% traffic)
2. Monitor metrics (errors, latency, business KPIs)
3. Gradually increase traffic if metrics healthy
4. Rollback if issues detected

**Advantages**: Risk mitigation, early detection of issues
**Disadvantages**: Complex traffic routing, monitoring overhead

## Breaking Change Management

### API Versioning Strategies

**URL Versioning**: `/api/v1/users` vs `/api/v2/users`
- Pros: Clear, explicit, easy to route
- Cons: URL proliferation, duplicate endpoints

**Header Versioning**: `Accept: application/vnd.company.v2+json`
- Pros: Clean URLs, flexible
- Cons: Less visible, routing complexity

**Content Negotiation**: `Accept: application/json; version=2`
- Pros: RESTful, flexible
- Cons: Complex routing, less discoverable

### Deprecation Process

1. **Announce**: Notify consumers 90 days before deprecation
2. **Document**: Update API docs with deprecation notice
3. **Monitor**: Track usage of deprecated endpoints
4. **Sunset**: Remove deprecated endpoints after grace period
5. **Support**: Provide migration guide and support

### Backward Compatibility Techniques

**Additive Changes**: Add new fields without removing old fields
**Default Values**: Provide sensible defaults for new required fields
**Adapter Pattern**: Create adapters to translate old to new format
**Feature Flags**: Toggle new behavior without deploying new code
**Dual Write**: Write to both old and new data stores during migration

## Integration with Other Flows

### With Change Control
- Architecture changes trigger change control process
- Architecture baseline updated after change approval
- Change impact analysis references architecture documentation

### With Gate Checks
- Architecture ADRs reviewed at phase gates
- Architecture evolution readiness is gate criterion
- Architecture risks assessed at each gate

### With Testing
- Architecture changes require updated test strategy
- Breaking changes require consumer contract testing
- Migration requires migration testing (data integrity, rollback)

## Common Failure Modes

### Undiscovered Breaking Changes
**Symptoms**: Production incidents after migration, consumer failures

**Remediation**:
1. Implement consumer-driven contract testing
2. Maintain API changelog
3. Automated breaking change detection in CI/CD
4. Require consumer signoff before migration

### Inadequate Rollback Plan
**Symptoms**: Unable to rollback, stuck in broken state

**Remediation**:
1. Test rollback plan in staging before production
2. Define rollback triggers clearly
3. Automate rollback process
4. Schedule rollback drills

### Architecture Drift
**Symptoms**: Implementation deviates from documented architecture

**Remediation**:
1. Implement architecture fitness functions (automated checks)
2. Regular architecture reviews (quarterly)
3. Code review checklist includes architecture compliance
4. Update architecture documentation when deviations occur

### Over-Engineering
**Symptoms**: Architecture too complex for current needs, premature optimization

**Remediation**:
1. Apply YAGNI principle (You Aren't Gonna Need It)
2. Start simple, evolve as needs emerge
3. Validate assumptions with prototypes
4. Defer decisions until last responsible moment

- [ ] Architecture evolution trigger assessed and justified
- [ ] Architecture options analyzed (at least 3)
- [ ] ADR created and approved by stakeholders
- [ ] Breaking changes identified and impact assessed
- [ ] Migration plan created with rollback strategy
