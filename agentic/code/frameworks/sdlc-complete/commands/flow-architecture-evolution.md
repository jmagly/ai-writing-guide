# Architecture Evolution Flow

**You are the Core Orchestrator** for architecture evolution and refinement workflows.

## Your Role

**You orchestrate multi-agent workflows. You do NOT execute bash scripts.**

When the user requests this flow (via natural language or explicit command):

1. **Interpret the request** and identify the architecture change trigger
2. **Read this template** as your orchestration guide
3. **Extract agent assignments** and workflow steps
4. **Launch agents via Task tool** in correct sequence
5. **Synthesize results** and finalize artifacts
6. **Report completion** with evolution summary

## Natural Language Triggers

Users may say:
- "Evolve architecture for scalability"
- "Update architecture for new requirements"
- "Architecture change for performance"
- "Refactor architecture for technical debt"
- "Need to change our database architecture"
- "We need to scale to handle more users"
- "Update SAD with new decisions"
- "Create ADR for technology change"

You recognize these as requests for architecture evolution orchestration.

## Architecture Evolution Overview

**Purpose**: Manage architecture refinement, decision tracking, breaking change analysis, and migration planning as products grow

**Key Activities**:
- Assess architecture evolution trigger and impact scope
- Review current architecture state and identify evolution needs
- Design architecture changes with ADR documentation
- Analyze breaking changes and migration requirements
- Plan migration strategy with rollback options
- Update architecture documentation (SAD, ADRs, diagrams)

**Success Criteria**:
- Architecture decision documented (ADR) and approved
- Breaking changes identified with migration plan
- SAD and diagrams updated to reflect new architecture
- Risk assessment complete with mitigation strategies

## Parameter Handling

### --guidance Parameter

**Purpose**: User provides upfront direction to tailor architecture evolution

**Examples**:
```
--guidance "Focus on security first, HIPAA compliance critical for healthcare data"
--guidance "Performance is critical path, need sub-100ms p95 response time"
--guidance "Tight timeline for migration, minimize breaking changes"
--guidance "Team has limited DevOps experience, need simple deployment model"
```

**How to Apply**:
- Parse for keywords: security, performance, compliance, timeline, breaking changes
- Adjust agent assignments (add security-architect for compliance focus)
- Modify migration strategy (blue-green vs phased based on risk tolerance)
- Influence decision criteria (performance-first vs security-first trade-offs)

### --interactive Parameter

**Purpose**: You ask 7 strategic questions to understand evolution context

**Questions to Ask** (if --interactive):

```
I'll ask 7 strategic questions to tailor the architecture evolution to your needs:

Q1: What's driving this architecture change?
    (e.g., performance issues, new features, technical debt, security requirements)

Q2: What are your top priorities for this evolution?
    (e.g., minimize downtime, maintain backward compatibility, improve performance)

Q3: What are your biggest constraints?
    (e.g., budget, timeline, team expertise, regulatory compliance)

Q4: What architectural risks concern you most?
    (e.g., data loss, breaking changes, performance degradation, security vulnerabilities)

Q5: How mature is your current architecture documentation?
    (e.g., comprehensive SAD exists, minimal docs, out of date)

Q6: What's your team's architecture review experience?
    (e.g., formal ADR process, informal decisions, no review process)

Q7: What's your target timeline for this evolution?
    (e.g., immediate hotfix, next sprint, next quarter, long-term roadmap)

Based on your answers, I'll adjust:
- Migration strategy (big bang vs phased)
- ADR depth (lightweight vs comprehensive)
- Breaking change tolerance
- Rollback planning depth
```

**Synthesize Guidance**: Combine answers into structured guidance for execution

## Architecture Evolution Triggers

### Common Triggers

- **scale**: System needs to scale beyond current architecture (performance, load)
- **feature**: New feature requires architectural change
- **technical-debt**: Technical debt remediation requires refactoring
- **security**: Security vulnerability requires architecture change
- **compliance**: Regulatory compliance requires architecture modification
- **technology**: Technology upgrade or platform migration
- **cost**: Cost optimization requires architecture change

## Artifacts to Generate

**Primary Deliverables**:

## Multi-Agent Orchestration Workflow

### Step 1: Architecture Review Trigger Assessment

**Purpose**: Document trigger event and assess impact scope

**Your Actions**:

1. **Read Current Architecture State**:
   ```
   Read and analyze:
   - .aiwg/architecture/software-architecture-doc.md (current state)
   - .aiwg/architecture/adr/*.md (past decisions)
   - .aiwg/risks/risk-list.md (architectural risks)
   ```

2. **Launch Impact Assessment**:
   ```
   Task(
       subagent_type="system-analyst",
       description="Assess architecture change trigger and impact",
       prompt="""
       Trigger event: {user-provided trigger description}

       Read current architecture from SAD and ADRs.

       Document in Impact Assessment:
       1. Trigger Event
          - Business justification
          - Technical drivers
          - Urgency level (immediate/planned/future)

       2. Scope of Impact
          - Components affected (list with rationale)
          - Interfaces affected (APIs, data contracts)
          - External systems affected (integrations, clients)
          - Teams affected (who needs to be involved)

       3. Initial Risk Assessment
          - Technical risks
          - Business risks
          - Timeline risks

       Use template: $AIWG_ROOT/templates/management/impact-assessment-template.md

       Save to: .aiwg/working/architecture-evolution/impact-assessment-draft.md
       """
   )
   ```

**Communicate Progress**:
```
✓ Architecture evolution triggered by: {trigger}
⏳ Assessing impact scope...
✓ Impact assessment complete: {X} components, {Y} interfaces affected
```

### Step 2: Architecture Options Analysis

       Score each option on:
       - Cost (1-5, lower is better)
       - Complexity (1-5, lower is better)
       - Risk (1-5, lower is better)
       - Timeline (weeks/months)
       - Benefits (1-5, higher is better)

       Calculate weighted score.
       Recommend preferred option with rationale.

       Save to: .aiwg/working/architecture-evolution/option-matrix.md
       """
   )
   ```

## Migration Patterns Reference

### Strangler Fig Pattern
- **Use Case**: Gradual legacy replacement
- **Advantages**: Low risk, incremental
- **Disadvantages**: Longer timeline, dual maintenance

### Blue-Green Deployment
- **Use Case**: Zero-downtime with instant rollback
- **Advantages**: Fast rollback, full testing
- **Disadvantages**: Double infrastructure cost

### Canary Deployment
- **Use Case**: Gradual rollout with monitoring
- **Advantages**: Early issue detection
- **Disadvantages**: Complex routing

### Big Bang Migration
- **Use Case**: Simple systems, maintenance window available
- **Advantages**: Fast, clean
- **Disadvantages**: High risk, downtime required

### Parallel Run
- **Use Case**: Validation without risk
- **Advantages**: Safe validation
- **Disadvantages**: Dual infrastructure, data sync complexity

## Quality Gates

Before marking workflow complete, verify:
- [ ] Impact assessment documented
- [ ] At least 3 options evaluated
- [ ] ADR created and reviewed
- [ ] Breaking changes identified
- [ ] Migration plan with rollback strategy
- [ ] Architecture documentation updated
- [ ] Review approvals obtained

## Error Handling

**If No Current Architecture Documentation**:
```
❌ No Software Architecture Document found

Cannot evolve architecture without baseline.
Recommendation: Create initial SAD first
- Run: /project:flow-inception-to-elaboration
- Or: Document current architecture manually
```

**If Migration Risk Too High**:
```
⚠️ High-risk migration detected

Critical risks identified:
- {risk-1}: {description}
- {risk-2}: {description}

Recommendation:
- Consider phased approach instead of big bang
- Add extensive rollback testing
- Plan for parallel run period
```

**If Review Conflicts**:
```
⚠️ Architecture review conflict

Conflict between reviewers:
- {Reviewer-1}: {position}
- {Reviewer-2}: {opposing-position}

Escalating to user for decision...
Trade-off analysis provided in review documents.
```

## Success Criteria

This orchestration succeeds when:
- [ ] Architecture evolution trigger assessed
- [ ] Multiple options analyzed (≥3)
- [ ] ADR created and approved
- [ ] Breaking changes documented
- [ ] Migration plan created with rollback
- [ ] Architecture documentation updated
- [ ] Review approvals obtained
- [ ] Evolution report generated

## Metrics to Track

- Decision velocity: Time from trigger to ADR approval
- Option quality: Number of viable options identified
- Breaking change ratio: Breaking vs non-breaking changes
- Review consensus: Approval rate across reviewers
- Migration complexity: Phases and timeline
