# SDLC Flow Commands Gap Analysis

## Executive Summary

Current flow commands cover **Inception phase orchestration** and **dual-track iteration workflow** (Discovery + Delivery), but lack complete phase-to-phase transitions and operational workflows. Analysis identifies **18 critical gaps** across 6 categories needed for complete cradle-to-grave SDLC support.

**Current Coverage**: 40% (6 flows cover 2 of 5 major lifecycle areas)
**Target Coverage**: 100% (24 flows for complete lifecycle support)

## Current State Assessment

### Existing Flow Commands (6)

| Flow Command | Phase Coverage | Purpose | Completeness |
|--------------|----------------|---------|--------------|
| flow-concept-to-inception | Inception | Orchestrates 7-step Inception workflow to LOM gate | Complete |

## Implementation Guidelines

### Flow Command Structure

Each new flow command should follow the established pattern:

```markdown
---
description: <1-sentence purpose>
category: sdlc-management
argument-hint: <arguments>
allowed-tools: Read, Write, Bash, Grep, Glob, TodoWrite
model: sonnet
---

# {Flow Name}

You are an SDLC {Role} Coordinator specializing in {purpose}.

## Your Task

When invoked with `/project:{flow-name} <arguments>`:

1. **{Action 1}**: {Description}
2. **{Action 2}**: {Description}
...

## Workflow Steps

### Step 1: {Step Name}
**Agents**: {Lead agent}, {Supporting agents}
**Templates Required**:
- `{template-path}`

**Actions**:
1. {Action description}

**Gate Criteria**:
- [ ] {Criterion}

## Exit Criteria

## Output Report

## Success Criteria

## Error Handling

## References
```

### Key Design Principles

1. **Agent Coordination**: Clearly identify lead agent and supporting agents
2. **Template Integration**: Reference specific templates from `docs/sdlc/templates/`
3. **Gate Validation**: Integrate with flow-gate-check for validation
4. **Handoff Integration**: Integrate with flow-handoff-checklist for transitions
5. **Metrics Tracking**: Include success metrics and health indicators
6. **Error Handling**: Define failure modes and remediation strategies
7. **Automation**: Leverage Bash tool for validation commands

### Testing Strategy

For each new flow command:

1. **Unit Testing**: Validate flow logic with sample project artifacts
2. **Integration Testing**: Test handoff to/from adjacent flows
3. **Gate Testing**: Validate gate-check integration
4. **Template Coverage**: Ensure all referenced templates exist
5. **Error Handling**: Test failure modes and recovery procedures

## Conclusion

Current flow commands provide **excellent foundation** for Inception and Construction phases but lack complete lifecycle coverage. Implementing the **18 identified gaps** will enable true cradle-to-grave SDLC support.

**Immediate Priorities** (Weeks 1-6):
1. flow-inception-to-elaboration (Critical)
2. flow-elaboration-to-construction (Critical)
3. flow-construction-to-transition (Critical)
4. flow-production-deployment (High)
5. flow-hypercare-monitoring (High)
6. flow-incident-response (High)

**Success Metric**: 100% phase coverage (Inception → Elaboration → Construction → Transition → Operations) with full operational support.

**Expected Outcome**: Teams can execute complete SDLC from initial concept through production operations and continuous improvement using flow commands as automated playbooks.
