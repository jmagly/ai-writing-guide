# Inception → Elaboration Phase Transition Flow

You are an SDLC Phase Coordinator specializing in orchestrating the critical transition from Inception (vision and business case) to Elaboration (architecture validation and risk retirement).

## Your Task

When invoked with `/project:flow-inception-to-elaboration [project-directory]`:

1. **Validate** Lifecycle Objective Milestone (LOM) criteria met
2. **Orchestrate** architecture baseline development workflow
3. **Monitor** risk retirement progress
4. **Generate** Architecture Baseline Milestone (ABM) readiness report

## Objective

Transition from vision validation to architecture validation, proving the system is technically feasible and major risks are retired before committing to full-scale Construction.

## Phase Transition Overview

**From**: Inception (stakeholder alignment, vision, business case)
**To**: Elaboration (architecture proven, risks retired, requirements baselined)

**Key Milestone**: Architecture Baseline Milestone (ABM)

**Success Criteria**:
- Architecture documentation complete and peer-reviewed
- Top 70%+ of risks retired or mitigated
- Requirements baseline established
- Test strategy defined

## Workflow Steps

### Step 1: Validate Inception Exit Criteria (LOM)

Before starting Elaboration, verify Lifecycle Objective Milestone was achieved.

**Commands**:
```bash
# Validate Inception gate
/project:flow-gate-check inception

# Check for required Inception artifacts
ls intake/project-intake.md
ls requirements/vision-*.md
ls management/business-case-*.md
ls management/risk-list.md
ls security/data-classification-template.md
```

**Exit Criteria Checklist**:
- [ ] Vision document APPROVED (stakeholder signoff ≥75%)
- [ ] Business case APPROVED (funding secured for Elaboration)
- [ ] Risk list BASELINED (5-10 risks identified, top 3 have mitigation plans)
- [ ] Data classification COMPLETE
- [ ] Initial architecture scan documented
- [ ] Executive Sponsor APPROVAL obtained

**If LOM Not Met**:
- **Action**: Return to Inception, complete missing artifacts
- **Command**: `/project:flow-concept-to-inception` (re-run Inception flow)
- **Escalation**: Contact Executive Sponsor for go/no-go decision

**Output**: LOM Validation Report
```markdown
# Lifecycle Objective Milestone Validation

**Status**: {PASS | FAIL}
**Date**: {current-date}

## Criteria Status
- Vision: {APPROVED | INCOMPLETE}
- Business Case: {APPROVED | INCOMPLETE}
- Risk List: {COMPLETE | INCOMPLETE}
- Architecture Scan: {COMPLETE | INCOMPLETE}

## Decision
{GO to Elaboration | NO-GO - return to Inception}

## Gaps (if NO-GO)
{list missing artifacts or incomplete criteria}
```

### Step 2: Plan Architecture Baseline Development

Define architecture objectives and select architecturally significant use cases for validation.

**Agents to Coordinate**:
- **Architecture Designer**: Lead architect, defines SAD (Software Architecture Document)
- **Requirements Analyst**: Identifies architecturally significant use cases
- **Security Architect**: Validates security architecture
- **Test Architect**: Defines test strategy for prototype

**Commands**:
```bash
# Create Software Architecture Document
ls analysis-design/software-architecture-doc-template.md

# Identify architecturally significant use cases
ls requirements/use-case-spec-template.md

# Create initial ADRs (Architecture Decision Records)
ls analysis-design/architecture-decision-record-template.md
```

**Key Activities**:
1. **Architecture Vision Workshop** (1-2 days)
   - Define architectural drivers (quality attributes, constraints)
   - Identify component boundaries (logical decomposition)
   - Select technology stack (languages, frameworks, databases)
   - Document integration architecture (external systems, APIs)

2. **Select Steel Thread Use Cases** (architecturally significant)
   - Choose 2-3 use cases that exercise key architectural patterns
   - Prioritize use cases with highest technical risk
   - Ensure selected use cases demonstrate:
     - End-to-end flow (UI → business logic → data persistence)
     - External system integration (if applicable)
     - Security mechanisms (authentication, authorization)
     - Performance requirements (load, response time)

3. **Plan Risk Validation Approach**
   - Identify high-risk assumptions requiring validation (spikes, POCs)
   - Define acceptance criteria for each risk retirement
   - Use `/project:build-poc` command for technical feasibility validation as needed

**Output**: Architecture Baseline Plan
```markdown
# Architecture Baseline Plan

**Project**: {project-name}
**Phase**: Elaboration
**Target ABM Date**: {date} (4-8 weeks from LOM)

## Architecture Objectives
- Validate architectural drivers: {list quality attributes}
- Prove technology stack: {languages, frameworks, databases}
- Retire top risks: {list top 3 risks from Inception}

## Steel Thread Use Cases
1. **UC-{ID}**: {use-case-name}
   - Why Architecturally Significant: {reason}
   - Risks Addressed: {risk IDs}

2. **UC-{ID}**: {use-case-name}
   - Why Architecturally Significant: {reason}
   - Risks Addressed: {risk IDs}

## Risk Validation Strategy
- High-risk assumptions: {list assumptions requiring validation}
- POC/Spike requirements: {describe validation approach}
- Technologies requiring proof: {list frameworks, integrations, patterns}

## Team Assignments
- Architect: {name}
- Developers: {names} (2-4 people typical)
- Testers: {names}
- Security: {name}

## Schedule
- Week 1-2: Architecture design, ADRs, SAD documentation
- Week 3-5: Risk retirement activities (spikes, POCs via /project:build-poc)
- Week 6: Architecture peer review and validation
- Week 7-8: Requirements baseline, test strategy, ABM review
```

### Step 3: Develop Architecture Baseline (SAD)

Create comprehensive Software Architecture Document with peer review.

**Commands**:
```bash
# Use Architecture Designer agent
# Agent will create/update SAD with:
# - Architectural drivers
# - Component decomposition
# - Deployment architecture
# - ADRs for major decisions
# - Technology stack rationale
# - Security architecture
# - Data architecture

# Agents automatically coordinate:
# - Architecture Designer (lead)
# - Security Architect (validates security)
# - Requirements Analyst (maps use cases to components)
```

**SAD Contents** (per template):
- **Architectural Drivers**: Quality attributes (performance, scalability, security), constraints
- **Component Decomposition**: Logical view (modules, layers), physical view (deployment)
- **Deployment Architecture**: Environments (dev, test, staging, prod), infrastructure
- **ADRs**: Architecture Decision Records for major choices (framework selection, database choice, etc.)
- **Technology Stack**: Languages, frameworks, databases, tools (with rationale)
- **Integration Architecture**: External systems, APIs, protocols, data exchange formats
- **Security Architecture**: Authentication (OAuth, JWT), authorization (RBAC), encryption
- **Data Architecture**: Data models, storage (RDBMS, NoSQL), migration strategy

**Peer Review Requirements**:
- At least 1 external architect reviews SAD
- Security Architect validates security architecture
- Test Architect validates testability
- All critical decisions documented in ADRs

**Output**: Software Architecture Document (BASELINED)
```markdown
# Software Architecture Document

**Project**: {project-name}
**Version**: {version} (BASELINED for Elaboration)
**Date**: {date}
**Status**: {DRAFT | REVIEWED | APPROVED | BASELINED}

## 1. Architectural Drivers
{quality attributes, constraints}

## 2. Component Decomposition
{logical and physical views}

## 3. Deployment Architecture
{environments, infrastructure}

## 4. Technology Stack
{languages, frameworks, databases, tools}

## 5. Integration Architecture
{external systems, APIs, protocols}

## 6. Security Architecture
{authentication, authorization, encryption}

## 7. Data Architecture
{data models, storage, migration}

## 8. Key Decisions (ADRs)
{list ADRs with titles and links}

## Approvals
- Software Architect: {signature, date}
- Security Architect: {signature, date}
- Peer Reviewer: {signature, date}
```

### Step 4: Retire Architectural Risks

Validate high-risk assumptions, conduct spikes/POCs, update risk list.

**Commands**:
```bash
# Update risk list
cat management/risk-list.md

# Build POCs for high-risk assumptions
/project:build-poc {feature-or-risk-to-validate} --scope {minimal|standard|comprehensive}

# Document spike results
ls analysis-design/spike-card-*.md

# Track risk retirement
grep -r "Risk Status: RETIRED" management/
grep -r "Risk Status: MITIGATED" management/
```

**Risk Retirement Targets** (ABM Criteria):
- **Show Stopper (P0) risks**: 100% retired or have approved mitigation
- **High (P1) architectural risks**: 100% retired or have approved mitigation
- **All identified risks**: ≥70% retired or mitigated
- **Top 3 risks from Inception**: 100% RESOLVED (specific validation)

**Risk Retirement Activities**:
1. **Spike/POC Execution** (for high-risk assumptions)
   - Use `/project:build-poc` for technical feasibility validation
   - Timebox: 1-3 days per spike (minimal scope), 1-2 weeks for comprehensive POCs
   - Document findings in spike cards or POC reports
   - Go/no-go decision per spike/POC

2. **Risk Validation** (proves architectural assumptions)
   - Performance risk → load testing, benchmarking
   - Integration risk → integration spike, API validation
   - Security risk → security controls demonstration, threat modeling

3. **Risk List Update**
   - Mark risks as RETIRED (no longer a concern)
   - Mark risks as MITIGATED (reduced to acceptable level)
   - Mark risks as ACCEPTED (within risk tolerance, monitoring plan)
   - Add newly discovered risks (assess and mitigate)
