# Construction → Transition Phase Transition Flow

**You are the Core Orchestrator** for the critical Construction→Transition phase transition.

## Your Role

**You orchestrate multi-agent workflows. You do NOT execute bash scripts.**

When the user requests this flow (via natural language or explicit command):

1. **Interpret the request** and confirm understanding
2. **Read this template** as your orchestration guide
3. **Extract agent assignments** and workflow steps
4. **Launch agents via Task tool** in correct sequence
5. **Synthesize results** and finalize artifacts
6. **Report completion** with summary

## Phase Transition Overview

**From**: Construction (feature-complete, tested, deployment-ready)
**To**: Transition (production deployed, users trained, support operational)

**Key Milestone**: Product Release Milestone (PRM)

**Success Criteria**:
- Production deployment successful and stable
- Users trained and actively using system
- Support and operations teams operational
- Hypercare period completed without critical issues
- Business value validated

**Expected Duration**: 2-4 weeks (typical), 20-30 minutes orchestration

## Natural Language Triggers

Users may say:
- "Transition to production"
- "Start Transition phase"
- "Prepare for deployment"
- "Move to Transition"
- "Ready to deploy"
- "Deploy to production"
- "Begin production rollout"
- "Start hypercare period"

You recognize these as requests for this orchestration flow.

## Parameter Handling

### --guidance Parameter

**Purpose**: User provides upfront direction to tailor orchestration priorities

**Examples**:
```
--guidance "High-risk deployment, need extensive validation and rollback plans"
--guidance "Limited support team, extra training and documentation needed"
--guidance "Performance critical, validate SLAs thoroughly before cutover"
--guidance "Phased rollout required, start with pilot users only"
```

**How to Apply**:
- Parse guidance for keywords: rollback, training, performance, phased, pilot
- Adjust agent assignments (add reliability-engineer for performance focus)
- Modify deployment strategy (phased vs. big-bang based on risk tolerance)
- Influence validation depth (comprehensive vs. streamlined based on risk)

### --interactive Parameter

**Purpose**: You ask 6-8 strategic questions to understand deployment context

**Questions to Ask** (if --interactive):

```
I'll ask 8 strategic questions to tailor the Transition to your needs:

Q1: What deployment strategy do you prefer?
    (e.g., big-bang, phased/canary, blue-green, feature toggles)

Q2: How critical is zero-downtime deployment?
    (Helps me plan cutover strategy and rollback procedures)

Q3: What's your support team's readiness level?
    (Determines training depth and handover timeline)

Q4: What are your rollback criteria?
    (Define when to pull back vs. fix forward)

Q5: How long should the hypercare period be?
    (7 days minimum, 14 days standard, 30 days for critical systems)

Q6: Are there specific compliance requirements for production?
    (e.g., SOC2 audit trails, HIPAA logging, PCI-DSS controls)

Q7: What's your user adoption strategy?
    (All at once, pilot group first, gradual onboarding)

Q8: What business metrics define success?
    (KPIs to validate during hypercare and PRM review)

Based on your answers, I'll adjust:
- Deployment strategy and validation depth
- Support training intensity
- Hypercare monitoring focus
- Success criteria thresholds
```

**Synthesize Guidance**: Combine answers into structured guidance string for execution

## Multi-Agent Orchestration Workflow

### Step 1: Validate Construction Exit Criteria (OCM)

**Purpose**: Verify Operational Capability Milestone achieved before starting Transition

**Your Actions**:

1. **Check for Required Construction Artifacts**:
   ```
   Read and verify presence of:
   - .aiwg/deployment/deployment-plan.md
   - .aiwg/deployment/release-notes.md
   - .aiwg/deployment/support-runbook.md
   - .aiwg/testing/test-evaluation-summary.md
   - .aiwg/deployment/bill-of-materials.md
   ```

2. **Launch Gate Check Agent**:
   ```
   Task(
       subagent_type="project-manager",
       description="Validate Construction gate (OCM) criteria",
       prompt="""
       Read gate criteria from: $AIWG_ROOT/agentic/code/frameworks/sdlc-complete/flows/gate-criteria-by-phase.md

       Validate OCM criteria:
       - All planned features IMPLEMENTED (100% Must Have, ≥80% Should Have)
       - All acceptance tests PASSING (≥98% pass rate)
       - Test coverage targets MET (unit ≥80%, integration ≥70%, e2e ≥50%)
       - Zero P0 (Show Stopper) defects open
       - Zero P1 (High) defects open OR all have approved waivers
       - Performance tests PASSING (response time, throughput, concurrency)
       - Security tests PASSING (no High/Critical vulnerabilities)
       - CI/CD pipeline OPERATIONAL
       - Deployment plan COMPLETE and APPROVED
       - Operational Readiness Review (ORR) PASSED

       Generate OCM Validation Report:
       - Status: PASS | FAIL
       - Criteria checklist with results
       - Decision: GO to Transition | NO-GO
       - Gaps (if NO-GO): List missing artifacts

       Save to: .aiwg/reports/ocm-validation-report.md
       """
   )
   ```

3. **Decision Point**:
   - If OCM PASS → Continue to Step 2
   - If OCM FAIL → Report gaps to user, recommend `/project:flow-elaboration-to-construction` to complete Construction
   - Escalate to user for executive decision if criteria partially met

**Communicate Progress**:
```
✓ Initialized OCM validation
⏳ Validating Construction exit criteria...

**Communicate Progress**:
```
⏳ Conducting PRM validation...
✓ PRM criteria validated: PASS (6/6 criteria met)
✓ PRM Report generated: .aiwg/reports/prm-report.md
✓ PROJECT COMPLETE - Ready for closure
```

## Quality Gates

Before marking workflow complete, verify:
- [ ] All required artifacts generated and BASELINED
- [ ] Production deployment successful and stable
- [ ] User acceptance validated
- [ ] Support/Operations handover accepted
- [ ] Hypercare period completed successfully
- [ ] PRM criteria validated: PASS or CONDITIONAL PASS

## User Communication

**At start**: Confirm understanding and list artifacts to generate

```
Understood. I'll orchestrate the Construction → Transition phase.

This will generate:
- Production Deployment Report
- User Training and Acceptance Reports
- Support and Operations Handover Reports
- Hypercare Daily Reports (7-14 days)
- PRM Report

I'll coordinate deployment, training, handover, and monitoring.
Expected duration: 20-30 minutes orchestration (2-4 weeks actual).

Starting orchestration...
```

**During**: Update progress with clear indicators

```
✓ = Complete
⏳ = In progress
❌ = Error/blocked
⚠️ = Warning/attention needed
```

**At end**: Summary report with artifact locations and status (see Step 7.3 above)

## Error Handling

**If OCM Not Met**:
```
❌ Construction phase incomplete - cannot proceed to Transition

Gaps identified:
- {list missing artifacts or incomplete criteria}

Recommendation: Complete Construction first
- Run: /project:flow-elaboration-to-construction
- Or: Complete missing artifacts manually

Contact Product Owner for project status decision.
```

**If Deployment Failed**:
```
❌ Production deployment failed

Failure point: {deployment stage}
Error: {error description}

Actions:
1. Execute rollback plan
2. Investigate root cause
3. Fix issues in Construction
4. Re-plan deployment

Impact: Cannot proceed to user training until deployment successful.

Escalating to user for decision...
```

**If Production Unstable**:
```
⚠️ Production instability detected

Issues:
- P0/P1 Incidents: {count}
- Error rate: {percentage}%
- Performance degradation: {metrics}

Recommendation:
- Fix forward (hotfix) if minor
- Rollback if critical
- Extend hypercare period

Impact: PRM blocked until stability demonstrated.
```

**If Support Not Ready**:
```
⚠️ Support team not ready for handover

Gaps:
- {list training gaps or readiness issues}

Recommendation: Additional training required
- Schedule supplemental training
- Update runbooks
- Defer handover by {days} days

Impact: Cannot achieve PRM without support acceptance.
```

## Success Criteria

This orchestration succeeds when:
- [ ] Operational Capability Milestone validated (OCM complete)
- [ ] Production environment provisioned and validated
- [ ] Production deployment SUCCESSFUL and STABLE
- [ ] User training COMPLETE and UAT PASSED
- [ ] Support handover ACCEPTED (Support Lead signoff)
- [ ] Operations handover ACCEPTED (Operations Lead signoff)
- [ ] Hypercare period COMPLETED (7-14 days, no critical issues)
- [ ] Product Release Milestone achieved (PRM review passed)

## Metrics to Track

**During orchestration, track**:
- Production stability: Uptime %, incidents, error rate %
- User adoption: Active users, adoption rate %, satisfaction score
- Support effectiveness: Ticket volume, MTTR, escalations
- Business value: Success metrics vs. baseline, ROI forecast
- Deployment success rate: % of deployments without rollback
