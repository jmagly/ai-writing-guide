# Intake Start (SDLC)

## Task

Given a Project Intake Form and Solution Profile:

1. **Process guidance** from user prompt (if provided) to tailor analysis
2. **Validate** required fields and note gaps
3. **Generate** or update phase-plan-inception.md and risk-list.md
4. **Recommend** initial ADRs and agent assignments
5. **Hand off** to Executive Orchestrator to start Concept → Inception flow

## Parameters

- **`<path-to-intake-folder-or-form>`** (required): Path to intake directory (default: `.aiwg/intake/`)
- **`--guidance "text"`** (optional): User-provided context to guide inception planning

### Guidance Parameter Usage

The `--guidance` parameter accepts free-form text to help tailor the Inception phase planning. Use it for:

**Process Focus**:
```bash
/project:intake-start .aiwg/intake/ --guidance "Focus on security architecture first, compliance is critical path"
```

**Risk Priorities**:
```bash
/project:intake-start .aiwg/intake/ --guidance "Third-party API integration is biggest unknown, needs spike ASAP"
```

**Team Constraints**:
```bash
/project:intake-start .aiwg/intake/ --guidance "Team has limited DevOps experience, need extra support for infrastructure setup"
```

**Stakeholder Expectations**:
```bash
/project:intake-start .aiwg/intake/ --guidance "Executive demo required in 2 weeks, need working prototype for fundraising"
```

**Technical Unknowns**:
```bash
/project:intake-start .aiwg/intake/ --guidance "Performance at scale unproven, need load testing POC before committing to architecture"
```

**How guidance influences planning**:
- **Prioritizes** specific risks based on guidance (e.g., "API integration" → elevate integration risks)
- **Tailors** agent assignments (e.g., "limited DevOps" → assign DevOps Engineer + provide training resources)
- **Adjusts** phase plan (e.g., "demo in 2 weeks" → front-load UI prototype tasks)
- **Highlights** critical path items (e.g., "compliance critical" → security gates moved earlier)
- **Documents** in phase-plan-inception.md (captures strategic focus and constraints)
- **Recommends** spikes/POCs based on unknowns mentioned in guidance

## Inputs

- `project-intake.md` (filled) - Comprehensive system documentation with metadata, architecture, scale, security, team details
- `solution-profile.md` (filled) - Current profile characteristics, improvement roadmap, risk mitigation, key decisions
- `option-matrix.md` (filled) - 6-step framework application analysis with priorities and trade-offs

## Outputs

- `phase-plan-inception.md` - Tailored inception plan based on validated intake
- `risk-list.md` - Prioritized risks with mitigation strategies
- `agent-assignments.md` - Recommended agent assignments based on project characteristics

## Workflow

### Step 1: Read and Process Guidance

If `--guidance` parameter provided:
- Extract guidance text from user prompt
- Document guidance in notes for later use
- Use guidance to prioritize validation checks (e.g., "security critical" → focus security validation)

**Default location**: `.aiwg/intake/` (or user-provided path)

**Required files**:
1. `project-intake.md`
2. `solution-profile.md`
3. `option-matrix.md`

**Error handling**:
- If path is a directory, look for files within it
- If path is a single file, read it and look for other files in same directory
- If files missing, report which ones and stop (cannot proceed without complete intake)

# Intake Validation Summary

**Validation Date**: {current date}
**Intake Path**: {path to intake directory}
**Guidance Provided**: {yes/no, summary if provided}

## Completeness Assessment

**Project Intake**: {COMPLETE | GAPS PRESENT | CRITICAL GAPS}
- {list critical gaps if any}
- {list moderate gaps if any}

**Solution Profile**: {COMPLETE | GAPS PRESENT | CRITICAL GAPS}
- {list critical gaps if any}
- {list moderate gaps if any}

```

**Decision point**:
- If **READY**: Proceed to Step 7 (Generate Phase Plan)
- If **NEEDS COMPLETION**: Output validation summary and STOP (user must complete intake)
- If **BLOCKED**: Output validation summary with resolution steps and STOP

### Step 7: Generate Phase Plan (Inception)

Create `phase-plan-inception.md` based on validated intake:

**Structure**:

```markdown
# Phase Plan: Inception

**Project**: {from project-intake metadata}
**Profile**: {from solution-profile}
**Generated**: {current date}
**Guidance Applied**: {summary of --guidance if provided}

## Phase Overview

**Duration**: {estimate based on profile: Prototype=1-2 weeks, MVP=2-4 weeks, Production=4-6 weeks, Enterprise=6-8 weeks}
**Team Size**: {from project-intake team section}
**Primary Focus**: {derived from option-matrix Step 4 intent}

## Phase Goals

1. **Architectural Foundation**: {from solution-profile improvement roadmap Phase 1}
2. **Risk Retirement**: {from solution-profile risk mitigation top risks}
3. **Team Alignment**: {from project-intake team section}
4. **Decision Making**: {from solution-profile key decisions}

## Priority-Driven Focus

**Top Priority** (from option-matrix Step 3): {highest weighted criterion}
**Implication**: {explain how this priority shapes Inception tasks}

**Examples**:
- If **Reliability/Scale** is top priority → focus architecture scalability, load testing POC, SLO definition
- If **Quality/Security** is top priority → focus security architecture, threat modeling, compliance review

**Guidance Provided**: "{verbatim guidance text}"

**Impact on Phase Plan**:
- {specific adjustment 1 based on guidance}
- {specific adjustment 2 based on guidance}
- {specific adjustment 3 based on guidance}

**Examples**:

## Success Criteria

**Inception complete when**:
1. Architecture baseline documented (ADRs approved)
2. Top 3 risks retired or mitigated
3. Critical decisions resolved
4. Team aligned on approach
5. Inception gate passed (ready for Elaboration)

## Next Phase

**Handoff to**: Elaboration
**Trigger**: Inception gate passed
**Preparation**: Update risk-list.md, generate phase-plan-elaboration.md
```

**Key tailoring points**:
1. **Duration** scales with profile (Prototype fast, Enterprise slow)
2. **Activities** pulled from solution-profile improvement roadmap Phase 1
3. **Risks** pulled from solution-profile risk mitigation
4. **Decisions** pulled from solution-profile key decisions
5. **Guidance** explicitly integrated and documented
6. **Priority focus** derived from option-matrix Step 3 weights

### Step 8: Generate Risk List

**Generated**: {current date}
**Last Updated**: {current date}

## Active Risks

{For each risk from solution-profile risk mitigation section}

### Risk #{n}: {Risk Name}

**Impact if Realized**: {from solution-profile impact description}

**Mitigation Strategies**:
1. {strategy 1 from solution-profile}
2. {strategy 2 from solution-profile}
3. {strategy 3 from solution-profile}

**Timeline**: {from solution-profile mitigation timeline}
**Owner**: {assign based on risk category}
**Last Review**: {current date}

---

{Repeat for all risks from solution-profile}

## Risk Register Summary

| ID | Risk Name | Impact | Probability | Status | Owner |
|----|-----------|--------|-------------|--------|-------|
| R1 | {name} | {H/M/L} | {H/M/L} | {status} | {owner} |
| R2 | {name} | {H/M/L} | {H/M/L} | {status} | {owner} |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

## Risk Burn-down Target

**Inception Phase Goal**: Retire or mitigate top 3 risks
**Elaboration Phase Goal**: Retire or mitigate remaining HIGH risks
**Construction Phase Goal**: Monitor and address emerging risks
**Transition Phase Goal**: All HIGH risks retired or accepted

## Next Review

**Date**: {1-2 weeks from current date}
**Trigger**: Weekly risk review meeting OR significant risk event
```

**Categorization logic**:
- **Technical**: Architecture, technology choice, integration, performance, scalability
- **Process**: Team coordination, code review, testing, deployment
- **Resource**: Team size, skill gaps, timeline, budget
- **External**: Third-party dependencies, vendor reliability, API changes
- **Compliance**: Regulatory requirements, security posture, data protection

**Owner assignment logic**:
- Technical risks → Architecture Designer or Component Owner
- Process risks → Project Manager or Executive Orchestrator
- Resource risks → Project Manager or Vision Owner
- External risks → Integration Engineer or API Designer
- Compliance risks → Security Architect or Legal Liaison

### Step 9: Generate Agent Assignments

Create `agent-assignments.md` based on option-matrix Step 5 framework application:

**Structure**:

```markdown
# Agent Assignments (Inception Phase)

**Project**: {from project-intake metadata}
**Profile**: {from solution-profile}
**Generated**: {current date}

## Assignment Strategy

**Process Rigor Level**: {from option-matrix Step 5}
**Team Size**: {from project-intake team section}
**Priority Focus**: {from option-matrix Step 3 top weight}

## Core Agents (Always Assigned)

## Risk-Driven Agents

{Based on solution-profile risk mitigation top risks}

**Risk**: {risk 1 name}
**Agent**: {appropriate agent for this risk category}
**Tasks**:
- {mitigation strategy 1}
- {mitigation strategy 2}

**Risk**: {risk 2 name}
**Agent**: {appropriate agent for this risk category}
**Tasks**:
- {mitigation strategy 1}

- Vision Owner (immediate)
- Architecture Designer (immediate)

**Week 2** (Risk and decision focus):
- {priority-driven agents}
- {risk-driven agents}

**Week 3-4** (As needed):
- {additional agents based on emerging needs}

## Handoff to Elaboration

**Agents continuing into Elaboration**:
- Executive Orchestrator (lifecycle coordination)
- Architecture Designer (architecture evolution)
- {priority-driven agents that remain relevant}

**Agents completing in Inception**:
- {agents whose work ends after Inception}

**New agents for Elaboration**:
- {agents not needed until Elaboration phase}
```

**Agent selection logic**:
1. **Core agents** (always): Executive Orchestrator, Vision Owner, Architecture Designer
2. **Priority-driven** (from option-matrix Step 3 weights): Match top priority to specialized agents
3. **Risk-driven** (from solution-profile risks): Assign agents who can mitigate specific risks
4. **Guidance-driven** (from --guidance parameter): Assign agents mentioned or implied by guidance
5. **Framework-driven** (from option-matrix Step 5): Assign checked agents from framework application

### Step 10: Generate Initial ADR Recommendations

Within phase-plan-inception.md, include section:

```markdown
## Recommended Initial ADRs

**ADR-001**: {Decision title from option-matrix architectural options recommendation}
- **Context**: {from option-matrix Step 1 project reality}
- **Decision**: {from option-matrix architectural options recommendation}
- **Rationale**: {from option-matrix recommendation rationale}
- **Status**: Proposed (to be reviewed in Week 2)

**ADR-002**: {Decision title from solution-profile key decisions}
- **Context**: {from solution-profile decision question}
- **Decision**: {from solution-profile recommendation}
- **Rationale**: {from solution-profile recommendation}
- **Status**: Proposed (to be reviewed in Week 2-3)

{Additional ADRs based on guidance or high-impact risks}

**Guidance**: If guidance mentions specific technical decisions or unknowns, recommend ADRs to address them.
```

### Step 11: Summary and Handoff

Output summary message to user:

```markdown
# Intake Start Complete

✅ **Validation**: All intake documents validated
✅ **Phase Plan**: phase-plan-inception.md generated
✅ **Risk List**: risk-list.md generated
✅ **Agent Assignments**: agent-assignments.md generated

## Key Insights

**Project**: {name}
**Profile**: {profile}
**Top Priority**: {priority}
**Biggest Risk**: {risk}
**Critical Decision**: {decision}

## Generated Artifacts

1. `phase-plan-inception.md` - {file size} KB
2. `risk-list.md` - {file size} KB
3. `agent-assignments.md` - {file size} KB

## Next Steps

1. **Review** generated artifacts (ensure alignment with expectations)
2. **Adjust** if needed (especially if guidance interpretation missed nuances)
3. **Execute** Inception phase using `/flow-concept-to-inception` command
4. **Coordinate** with assigned agents (Executive Orchestrator will orchestrate)

## Ready to Start?

To begin Inception phase execution:
```bash
/project:flow-concept-to-inception .aiwg/
```

This will activate the Executive Orchestrator and assigned agents to begin Inception activities.
```

## Error Handling

### Missing Files
- If project-intake.md missing: **STOP** - "Cannot proceed without project-intake.md. Please run /project:intake-wizard or /project:intake-from-codebase first."
- If solution-profile.md missing: **STOP** - "Cannot proceed without solution-profile.md. Please complete intake generation first."
- If option-matrix.md missing: **WARN** - "option-matrix.md missing. Will use defaults for priorities and framework application."

### Incomplete Sections
- If critical gaps found: **STOP** with validation summary - user must complete gaps before proceeding
- If moderate gaps found: **WARN** in validation summary - proceed with noted gaps
- If minor gaps found: **NOTE** in validation summary - proceed normally

### Conflicting Information
- If project-intake and solution-profile conflict (e.g., different team sizes): **WARN** and use project-intake as source of truth
- If option-matrix and solution-profile priorities conflict: **WARN** and use option-matrix Step 3 weights as source of truth

### Invalid Data
- If option-matrix Step 3 weights don't sum to 1.0: **STOP** - "Priority weights must sum to 1.0. Current sum: {calculated sum}. Please fix option-matrix.md."
- If profile not one of (Prototype/MVP/Production/Enterprise): **STOP** - "Invalid profile: {profile}. Must be one of: Prototype, MVP, Production, Enterprise."

## Best Practices

1. **Always validate before generating** - Don't generate phase plans from incomplete intake
2. **Leverage guidance parameter** - Use guidance to prioritize and tailor (don't ignore user's strategic intent)
3. **Be explicit about gaps** - Don't silently fill gaps with assumptions (warn user and document)
4. **Cross-reference documents** - Pull risks from solution-profile, priorities from option-matrix, architecture from project-intake
5. **Tailor to profile** - Prototype gets lightweight plan, Enterprise gets comprehensive plan
6. **Document guidance impact** - Explicitly show how guidance influenced phase plan (transparency builds trust)
