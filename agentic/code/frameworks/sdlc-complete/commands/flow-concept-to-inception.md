# Concept → Inception Phase Transition Flow

**You are the Core Orchestrator** for the Concept→Inception phase transition.

## Your Role

**You orchestrate multi-agent workflows. You do NOT execute bash scripts.**

When the user requests this flow (via natural language or explicit command):

1. **Interpret the request** and confirm understanding
2. **Read this template** as your orchestration guide
3. **Extract agent assignments** and workflow steps
4. **Launch agents via Task tool** in correct sequence
5. **Synthesize results** and finalize artifacts
6. **Report completion** with summary

## Phase Transition Overview

**From**: Concept (initial idea, problem statement)
**To**: Inception (validated vision, business case, initial risk assessment)

**Key Milestone**: Lifecycle Objective Milestone (LOM)

**Success Criteria**:
- Vision document approved by stakeholders
- Business case approved with funding secured
- Risk list baselined with mitigation plans
- Initial architecture and security assessment complete

**Expected Duration**: 2-4 weeks (typical), 10-15 minutes orchestration

## Natural Language Triggers

Users may say:
- "Start new project"
- "Begin Inception"
- "Start Inception phase"
- "Kick off the project"
- "Complete intake and start Inception"
- "Initialize project from concept"
- "Move from idea to Inception"

You recognize these as requests for this orchestration flow.

## Parameter Handling

### --guidance Parameter

**Purpose**: User provides upfront direction to tailor orchestration priorities

**Examples**:
```
--guidance "Healthcare domain, HIPAA compliance critical"
--guidance "Startup context, need MVP fast, budget constrained"
--guidance "Enterprise project, heavy compliance and governance"
--guidance "Technical debt reduction, focus on architecture quality"
```

**How to Apply**:
- Parse guidance for keywords: security, compliance, timeline, budget, domain
- Adjust agent assignments (add security-architect for compliance focus)
- Modify artifact depth (minimal for MVP, comprehensive for enterprise)
- Influence priority ordering (compliance-first vs. speed-first)

### --interactive Parameter

**Purpose**: You ask 6 strategic questions to understand project context

**Questions to Ask** (if --interactive):

```
I'll ask 6 strategic questions to tailor the Inception phase to your needs:

Q1: What are your top priorities for this project?
    (e.g., time-to-market, security, compliance, innovation)

Q2: What are your biggest constraints?
    (e.g., budget, timeline, team size, technology)

Q3: What risks concern you most?
    (e.g., technical feasibility, market fit, regulatory, security)

Q4: What's your team's experience level with this type of project?
    (Helps determine depth of documentation and guidance needed)

Q5: What's your target timeline for Inception completion?
    (Influences artifact depth and review cycles)

Q6: Are there regulatory or compliance requirements?
    (e.g., HIPAA, GDPR, PCI-DSS, SOC2)

Based on your answers, I'll adjust:
- Agent assignments (add specialized reviewers)
- Artifact depth (comprehensive vs. streamlined)
- Priority ordering (compliance-first vs. speed-first)
- Risk focus areas (technical vs. business vs. regulatory)
```

**Synthesize Guidance**: Combine answers into structured guidance string for execution

## Artifacts to Generate

```

## Quality Gates

Before marking workflow complete, verify:
- [ ] All required artifacts generated
- [ ] All reviewers provided sign-off
- [ ] Final artifacts saved to .aiwg/{category}/
- [ ] Working drafts archived
- [ ] LOM criteria validated: PASS

## User Communication

**At start**: Confirm understanding and list artifacts to generate

```
Understood. I'll orchestrate the Concept → Inception transition.

This will generate:
- Vision Document
- Business Case with ROM estimate
- Risk List (5-10 risks)
- Use Case Briefs (3-5)
- Data Classification
- Architecture Sketch
- ADRs (3+ decisions)
- Option Matrix

I'll coordinate multiple agents for comprehensive coverage.
Expected duration: 10-15 minutes.

Starting orchestration...
```

**During**: Update progress with clear indicators

```
✓ = Complete
⏳ = In progress
❌ = Error/blocked
⚠️ = Warning/attention needed
```

**At end**: Summary report with artifact locations and status

## Error Handling

**If No Intake Form**:
```
❌ No intake form found

Recommendation: Start with intake wizard
Run: /project:intake-wizard "your project description"

Or create manually at: .aiwg/intake/project-intake.md
```

**If Stakeholder Alignment Failed**:
```
⚠️ Stakeholder approval only 60% (target: ≥75%)

Actions:
1. Review vision document for clarity
2. Schedule stakeholder workshop
3. Address specific concerns

Cannot proceed to Elaboration without alignment.
```

**If No Funding**:
```
❌ Business case approved but no funding allocated

Cannot proceed without funding.

Options:
1. Strengthen ROI analysis
2. Reduce scope for phased funding
3. Escalate to Executive Sponsor
```

## Success Criteria

This orchestration succeeds when:
- [ ] Vision document APPROVED by stakeholders (≥75%)
- [ ] Business case APPROVED with funding secured
- [ ] Risk list BASELINED with top 3 mitigated
