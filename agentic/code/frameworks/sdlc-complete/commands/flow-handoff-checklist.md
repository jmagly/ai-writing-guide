# SDLC Handoff Checklist Flow

**You are the Core Orchestrator** for validating and executing handoffs between SDLC phases and tracks.

## Your Role

**You orchestrate multi-agent workflows. You do NOT execute bash scripts.**

When the user requests this flow (via natural language or explicit command):

1. **Interpret the request** and confirm understanding
2. **Read this template** as your orchestration guide
3. **Extract agent assignments** and workflow steps
4. **Launch agents via Task tool** in correct sequence
5. **Synthesize results** and finalize artifacts
6. **Report completion** with summary

## Natural Language Triggers

Users may say:
- "Check handoff readiness to Delivery"
- "Validate handoff from Discovery"
- "Verify handoff readiness for Operations"
- "Review handoff checklist"
- "Check if we're ready for phase transition"
- "Validate Definition of Ready"
- "Run operational readiness review"

You recognize these as requests for this orchestration flow.

## Parameter Handling

### --guidance Parameter

**Purpose**: User provides upfront direction to tailor handoff validation priorities

**Examples**:
```
--guidance "Focus on security compliance, SOC2 audit next month"
--guidance "Quick validation, team is waiting to start"
--guidance "Pay special attention to test coverage and documentation"
--guidance "First handoff, need detailed validation"
```

**How to Apply**:
- Parse guidance for keywords: security, documentation, testing, compliance, speed
- Adjust validation depth (comprehensive vs. essential checks)
- Modify agent assignments (add specialized validators)
- Influence priority ordering (critical checks first)

### --interactive Parameter

**Purpose**: You ask 5-7 strategic questions to understand handoff context

**Questions to Ask** (if --interactive):

```
I'll ask 7 strategic questions to tailor the handoff validation:

Q1: Is this your first handoff of this type?
    (Helps me determine validation thoroughness needed)

Q2: What's your biggest concern about this handoff?
    (e.g., incomplete requirements, missing tests, documentation gaps)

Q3: How urgent is this handoff?
    (Influences whether to do comprehensive or essential checks)

Q4: Are there any known gaps you're already aware of?
    (Helps focus validation on unknown issues)

Q5: Who are the key stakeholders who need to sign off?
    (Determines which reviewers to engage)

Q6: Are there any special compliance or regulatory requirements?
    (e.g., HIPAA, SOC2, PCI-DSS affects validation criteria)

Q7: What's your fallback plan if handoff is blocked?
    (Helps prepare contingency recommendations)

Based on your answers, I'll adjust:
- Validation depth (comprehensive vs. streamlined)
- Agent assignments (add specialized reviewers)
- Priority ordering (critical items first)
- Remediation recommendations
```

**Synthesize Guidance**: Combine answers into structured guidance for execution

## Supported Handoffs

### Phase Transitions
- **inception → elaboration**: Lifecycle Objective Milestone handoff
- **elaboration → construction**: Lifecycle Architecture Milestone handoff
- **construction → transition**: Operational Capability Milestone handoff
- **transition → operations**: Product Release Milestone handoff

### Track Handoffs
- **discovery → delivery**: Definition of Ready (DoR) validation
- **delivery → operations**: Operational Readiness Review (ORR)
- **delivery → discovery**: Feedback loop for rework/clarification

### Special Handoffs
- **intake → inception**: Project Intake to Inception kickoff
- **concept → inception**: Concept to Inception flow start

## Multi-Agent Orchestration Workflow

### Step 1: Identify and Load Handoff Checklist

**Purpose**: Determine which handoff checklist applies and load criteria

**Your Actions**:

1. **Parse Handoff Type**:
   ```
   Determine from user input:
   - From phase/track
   - To phase/track
   - Type: Phase transition, Track handoff, or Special
   ```

2. **Load Checklist Criteria**:
   ```
   Based on handoff type, identify:
   - Required artifacts
   - Validation criteria
   - Signoff requirements
   - Pass threshold
   ```

3. **Initialize Validation Workspace**:
   ```
   Create workspace structure:
   .aiwg/working/handoff/
   ├── artifacts/      # Artifact validation results
   ├── checklist/      # Checklist item validation
   ├── signoffs/       # Signoff status tracking
   └── report/         # Final handoff report
   ```

**Communicate Progress**:
```
✓ Handoff identified: {from-phase} → {to-phase}
✓ Checklist loaded: {checklist-name}
⏳ Starting validation...
```

### Step 2: Validate Required Artifacts

**Purpose**: Check presence and completeness of required artifacts

**Your Actions**:

1. **For Discovery → Delivery (Definition of Ready)**:
   ```
   Task(
       subagent_type="requirements-analyst",
       description="Validate Definition of Ready artifacts",
       prompt="""
       Check for required artifacts per backlog item:

       Requirements:
       - requirements/use-case-brief-{ID}.md
       - test/acceptance-test-card-{ID}.md

       Design (if applicable):
       - analysis-design/data-contract-card-{ID}.md
       - analysis-design/interface-card-{ID}.md

       Risk Management:
       - management/risk-card-{ID}.md (if high-risk)
       - analysis-design/spike-card-{ID}.md (if spike conducted)

       For each artifact:
       1. Check existence (file present)
       2. Validate completeness (all sections filled)
       3. Check approval status (stakeholder signoff)
       4. Verify currency (last updated within sprint)

       Output validation report:
       .aiwg/working/handoff/artifacts/dor-artifacts-validation.md
       """
   )
   ```

2. **For Delivery → Operations (Operational Readiness)**:
   ```
   Task(
       subagent_type="documentation-archivist",
       description="Validate Operational Readiness artifacts",
       prompt="""
       Check for required deployment artifacts:

       - deployment/runbook-*.md

       Testing:
       - test/test-evaluation-summary-template.md
       - test/acceptance-test-results-*.md

       Operations:
       - deployment/operational-readiness-review-template.md
       - support/support-plan-template.md
       - training/user-guide-template.md

       For each artifact:
       1. Verify existence and completeness
       2. Check version currency (matches release)
       3. Validate technical accuracy
       4. Confirm operational procedures documented

       Output validation report:
       .aiwg/working/handoff/artifacts/orr-artifacts-validation.md
       """
   )
   ```

3. **For Phase Transitions**:
   ```
   Task(
       subagent_type="project-manager",
       description="Validate phase transition artifacts",
       prompt="""
       Based on transition {from-phase} → {to-phase}:

       For inception → elaboration:
       - intake/project-intake-template.md
       - requirements/vision-*.md
       - management/business-case-*.md
       - management/risk-list.md
       - security/data-classification-template.md

       For elaboration → construction:
       - analysis-design/software-architecture-doc-template.md
       - requirements/supplemental-specification-template.md
       - test/master-test-plan-template.md
       - management/development-case-template.md

       Validate each artifact:
       1. Present and complete
       2. Reviewed and approved
       3. Baselined (version tagged)

       Output validation report:
       .aiwg/working/handoff/artifacts/phase-artifacts-validation.md
       """
   )
   ```

   ```
   Task(
       subagent_type="documentation-archivist",
       description="Create handoff package",
       prompt="""
       Create handoff package for {from-phase} → {to-phase}:

       1. Tag artifacts in version control:
          git tag {phase}-handoff-{YYYY-MM-DD}

       2. Create handoff package:
          .aiwg/handoffs/{from}-to-{to}/
          ├── artifacts/      # Copy of all artifacts
          ├── context/        # Context transfer docs
          ├── report.md       # Handoff report
          └── README.md       # Package overview

       3. Generate context transfer document:
          - Key decisions made
          - Outstanding risks
          - Technical debt
          - Lessons learned
          - Team recommendations

       4. Schedule handoff meeting:
          - Date: Within 1 week
          - Attendees: From and To teams
          - Agenda: Context transfer

       Output: .aiwg/handoffs/{from}-to-{to}/README.md

   ```

2. **For CONDITIONAL Handoffs**:
   ```
   Task(
       subagent_type="project-manager",
       description="Create conditional handoff plan",
       prompt="""
       Create action plan for conditional handoff:

       1. List conditions to be met:
          - {condition 1} - Owner - Due date
          - {condition 2} - Owner - Due date

       2. Create tracking mechanism:
          - TodoWrite entries for each condition
          - Daily check-ins scheduled

       3. Set re-validation date:
          - Target: {date}
          - Validator: {role}

       4. Define escalation path:
          - If conditions not met by {date}
          - Escalate to: {executive}

       Output: .aiwg/handoffs/conditional-plan-{from}-to-{to}.md
       """
   )
   ```

**Communicate Progress**:
```
✓ Handoff package created: .aiwg/handoffs/{from}-to-{to}/
✓ Version tagged: {phase}-handoff-{date}

```
Understood. I'll validate the {from-phase} → {to-phase} handoff.

This will check:
- Required artifacts presence and completeness
- Checklist criteria compliance
- Signoff status from stakeholders
- Overall handoff readiness

I'll coordinate multiple specialized agents for validation.
Expected duration: 10-15 minutes.

Starting handoff validation...
```

**During**: Update progress with clear indicators

```
✓ = Complete/Pass
⏳ = In progress
❌ = Failed/Missing
⚠️ = Warning/Conditional
```

**At end**: Summary report with decision and next steps

```

Handoff Validation Complete
─────────────────────────────────────────────

**Handoff**: Discovery → Delivery
**Decision**: APPROVED

**Summary**:
✓ Artifacts: 12/12 complete
✓ Checklist: 95% compliant (19/20 items)
✓ Signoffs: 3/3 obtained

**Minor Gaps** (non-blocking):
- Performance test scenarios need enhancement
  → Can be addressed during sprint

**Next Steps**:
1. Review handoff report: .aiwg/handoffs/handoff-report-discovery-to-delivery.md
2. Handoff meeting scheduled: Tuesday 10am
3. Delivery team can begin sprint planning

**Artifacts Transferred**:
- 5 use case briefs
- 5 acceptance test cards
- 3 interface specifications
- 2 spike results

Ready to proceed with Delivery phase.
─────────────────────────────────────────────
```

## Error Handling

**Unknown Handoff**:
```
❌ Unknown handoff: {from-phase} → {to-phase}

Supported handoffs:
- Phase: inception→elaboration, elaboration→construction, construction→transition
- Track: discovery→delivery, delivery→operations
- Special: intake→inception, concept→inception

Please specify a valid handoff type.
```

**Missing Critical Artifacts**:
```
❌ Critical artifacts missing - handoff BLOCKED

Missing:
- {artifact-1}: Required for {reason}
- {artifact-2}: Required for {reason}

These must be completed before handoff.
Recommended actions:
1. Complete {artifact-1} using template
2. Obtain stakeholder approval
3. Re-run handoff validation

Impact: Cannot proceed to {to-phase} until resolved.
```

**Failed Checklist Items**:
```
⚠️ Checklist compliance: {percentage}% (target: 100%)

Failed items:
- {item-1}: {reason for failure}
- {item-2}: {reason for failure}

Recommendation: Address failed items or obtain exception approval
```

**Declined Signoff**:
```
❌ Signoff declined by {role}

Reason: {feedback from role}

Actions required:
1. Address concerns raised
2. Update artifacts as needed
3. Request re-review

Escalation: Contact Project Manager if disagreement persists
```
