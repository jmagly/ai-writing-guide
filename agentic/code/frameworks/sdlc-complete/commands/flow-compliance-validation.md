# Compliance Validation Flow

**You are the Core Orchestrator** for comprehensive compliance validation and attestation.

## Your Role

**You orchestrate multi-agent workflows. You do NOT execute bash scripts.**

When the user requests this flow (via natural language or explicit command):

1. **Interpret the request** and confirm understanding
2. **Read this template** as your orchestration guide
3. **Extract agent assignments** and workflow steps
4. **Launch agents via Task tool** in correct sequence
5. **Synthesize results** and finalize artifacts
6. **Report completion** with summary

## Compliance Validation Overview

**Purpose**: Validate project compliance with regulatory frameworks (GDPR, HIPAA, SOC2, PCI-DSS, ISO 27001, etc.)

**Key Deliverables**:
- Compliance Requirements Matrix
- Control Mapping Documentation
- Gap Analysis Report
- Remediation Plans
- Audit Evidence Package
- Compliance Attestation

**Success Criteria**:
- All applicable requirements identified and mapped
- Audit evidence collected for all controls
- Critical and high gaps remediated or risk accepted
- Control effectiveness validated
- Compliance attestation signed by Executive Sponsor

**Expected Duration**: 2-4 weeks (typical), 20-30 minutes orchestration

## Natural Language Triggers

Users may say:
- "Check compliance"
- "Validate GDPR compliance"
- "Run compliance audit"
- "Verify regulatory compliance"
- "Check SOC2 readiness"
- "Assess HIPAA compliance"
- "Prepare for ISO 27001 audit"

You recognize these as requests for this orchestration flow.

## Parameter Handling

### Compliance Framework Parameter

**Required**: User must specify which framework to validate

**Supported Frameworks**:
- **sox**: Sarbanes-Oxley Act (financial controls)
- **hipaa**: Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (healthcare data)
- **gdpr**: General Data Protection Regulation (EU data privacy)
- **pci-dss**: Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (payment data)
- **iso27001**: ISO 27001 (information security management)
- **soc2**: SOC 2 Type I/II (service organization controls)
- **fedramp**: Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (US government cloud)
- **ccpa**: California Consumer Privacy Act (California data privacy)
- **nist**: NIST Cybersecurity Framework (US government security)

### --guidance Parameter

**Purpose**: User provides upfront direction to tailor compliance focus

**Examples**:
```
--guidance "Focus on data privacy controls, GDPR Article 25 critical"
--guidance "Tight audit deadline, prioritize critical gaps only"
--guidance "First-time audit, need comprehensive evidence collection"
--guidance "Already have partial evidence from last year's audit"
```

**How to Apply**:
- Parse guidance for keywords: privacy, security, audit, deadline, evidence
- Adjust agent assignments (add privacy-officer for GDPR, security-architect for SOC2)
- Modify validation depth (comprehensive vs. streamlined based on timeline)
- Influence priority ordering (critical gaps first vs. complete coverage)

### --interactive Parameter

**Purpose**: You ask 6 strategic questions to understand compliance context

**Questions to Ask** (if --interactive):

```
I'll ask 6 strategic questions to tailor the compliance validation to your needs:

Q1: What are your top priorities for this compliance activity?
    (e.g., passing external audit, internal readiness, specific control areas)

Q2: What are your biggest compliance constraints?
    (e.g., time to audit, resource availability, technical limitations)

Q3: What compliance risks concern you most?
    (e.g., data breaches, audit failure, regulatory penalties)

Q4: What's your team's experience level with this framework?
    (Helps me gauge guidance depth and evidence collection support)

Q5: What's your target timeline for attestation?
    (Influences remediation prioritization and evidence collection pace)

Q6: Are there specific areas where you expect gaps?
    (e.g., encryption, access control, audit logging)

Based on your answers, I'll adjust:
- Agent assignments (add specialized reviewers)
- Validation depth (comprehensive vs. targeted)
- Priority ordering (critical controls first)
- Remediation approach (quick fixes vs. systematic improvements)
```

**Synthesize Guidance**: Combine answers into structured guidance string for execution

       | Gap ID | Requirement | Severity | Risk | Effort | Priority | Owner | Timeline |
       |--------|------------|----------|------|--------|----------|-------|----------|

       Prioritization formula:
       - Critical gaps: MUST fix before attestation
       - High gaps: SHOULD fix or have risk acceptance
       - Medium gaps: Target for next cycle
       - Low gaps: Continuous improvement

       For each gap, specify:
       - Remediation approach
       - Success criteria
       - Validation method
       - Dependencies

✓ Remediation matrix created
⚠️ {count} critical gaps require immediate attention
```

### Step 4: Implement Remediation Plans

**Purpose**: Address critical and high-priority gaps

**Your Actions**:

1. **Create Detailed Remediation Plans** (parallel by gap severity):
   ```
   # Critical Gaps
   Task(
       subagent_type="security-architect",
       description="Create critical gap remediation plans",
       prompt="""
       Read remediation matrix (critical gaps)

       For each critical gap, create detailed plan:

       1. Gap Description
          - Current state
          - Required state
          - Compliance impact

       2. Remediation Steps
          - Specific technical actions
          - Configuration changes
          - Process updates
          - Documentation needs

       3. Success Criteria
          - How to verify remediation
          - Evidence to collect
          - Testing approach

       4. Timeline
          - Start date
          - Milestones
          - Completion date
          - Validation date

       5. Risk if Not Remediated
          - Compliance impact
          - Business impact
          - Recommended risk acceptance (if applicable)

       Output: .aiwg/compliance/remediation-plans/critical-{gap-id}.md
       """
   )

   # High Priority Gaps
   Task(
       subagent_type="compliance-specialist",
       description="Create high-priority gap remediation plans",
       prompt="""
       Similar structure for high-priority gaps
       Focus on quick wins and high-impact improvements

       Output: .aiwg/compliance/remediation-plans/high-{gap-id}.md
       """
   )
   ```

2. **Execute Quick Remediation** (where possible):
   ```
   Task(
       subagent_type="devops-engineer",
       description="Implement quick-fix remediations",
       prompt="""
       Read remediation plans (quick fixes only)

       For gaps that can be fixed immediately:
       1. Update configurations
       2. Enable logging/monitoring
       3. Document procedures
       4. Update access controls

       For each fix:
       - Document change made
       - Collect evidence of fix
       - Validate effectiveness
       - Update gap status

       Output: .aiwg/compliance/remediation-completed-{framework}.md
       """
   )
   ```

3. **Document Risk Acceptance** (for gaps not remediated):
   ```
   Task(
       subagent_type="legal-liaison",
       description="Document risk acceptance for unremediated gaps",
       prompt="""
       For gaps that cannot be remediated before attestation:

       Create risk acceptance documentation:
       1. Gap description and severity
       2. Why it cannot be remediated now
       3. Compensating controls (if any)
       4. Residual risk assessment
       5. Risk owner (must be executive level)
       6. Acceptance period (temporary vs. permanent)
       7. Re-evaluation date

       Output: .aiwg/compliance/risk-acceptance-{framework}.md
       """
   )
   ```

**Communicate Progress**:
```
⏳ Implementing remediation plans...
  ✓ Critical gap remediation: {count}/{total} complete

       prompt="""
       Read:
       - Requirements matrix
       - Remediation completed list

       For each control, design test:
       1. Test objective (what to validate)
       2. Test approach (how to test)
       3. Sample size (if sampling)
       4. Success criteria (pass/fail)
       5. Evidence to collect

       Test types:
       - Inquiry (interview control owners)
       - Observation (watch control in action)
       - Inspection (review evidence)
       - Re-performance (repeat control action)

       Output: .aiwg/compliance/control-test-plan-{framework}.md
       """
   )
   ```

2. **Execute Control Tests** (parallel by control domain):
   ```
   Task(
       subagent_type="security-tester",
       description="Test technical controls",

       - Evidence collected
       - Deficiencies noted

       Output: .aiwg/compliance/control-test-results-technical-{framework}.md
       """
   )

   Task(
       subagent_type="compliance-auditor",
       description="Test administrative controls",
       prompt="""
       Test administrative controls through:

       1. Policy review (current and approved)
       2. Training record inspection
       3. Process observation
       4. Staff interviews
       5. Documentation review

       Output: .aiwg/compliance/control-test-results-administrative-{framework}.md
       """
   )
   ```

3. **Consolidate Test Results**:
   ```
   Task(
       subagent_type="compliance-auditor",
       description="Consolidate control testing results",
       prompt="""
       Read all test results

       Create summary:
       - Total controls tested: {count}
       - Controls effective: {count} ({percentage}%)
       - Controls with deficiencies: {count}
       - Controls failed: {count}

       For deficiencies:
       - Categorize by severity
       - Determine if attestation blocker
       - Recommend remediation or acceptance

       Output: .aiwg/compliance/control-effectiveness-summary-{framework}.md
       """
   )
   ```

**Communicate Progress**:
```
⏳ Testing control effectiveness...
  ✓ Test plan created: {count} controls to test
  ✓ Technical controls tested: {percentage}% effective
  ✓ Administrative controls tested: {percentage}% effective
✓ Control testing complete: {percentage}% overall effectiveness
⚠️ {count} controls with deficiencies identified
```

{count} critical gaps must be addressed before attestation:
1. {gap description}
2. {gap description}

Options:
- Remediate gaps (recommended)
- Document compensating controls
- Obtain executive risk acceptance
- Defer attestation

Cannot proceed with attestation while critical gaps remain unremediated.
```

**Insufficient Evidence**:
```
❌ Insufficient evidence for compliance validation

Evidence gaps:
- {count} controls missing evidence
- {count} controls with outdated evidence

Actions needed:
1. Collect missing evidence
2. Update outdated documentation
3. Re-run validation

Compliance cannot be attested without sufficient evidence.
```
