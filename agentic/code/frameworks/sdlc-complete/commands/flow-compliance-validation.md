### Step 0: Parameter Parsing and Guidance Setup

**Parse Command Line**:

Extract optional `--guidance` and `--interactive` parameters.

```bash
# Parse arguments (flow-specific primary param varies)
PROJECT_DIR="."
GUIDANCE=""
INTERACTIVE=false

# Parse all arguments
while [[ $# -gt 0 ]]; do
  case "$1" in
    --guidance)
      GUIDANCE="$2"
      shift 2
      ;;
    --interactive)
      INTERACTIVE=true
      shift
      ;;
    --*)
      echo "Unknown option: $1"
      exit 1
      ;;
    *)
      # If looks like a path (contains / or is .), treat as project-directory
      if [[ "$1" == *"/"* ]] || [[ "$1" == "." ]]; then
        PROJECT_DIR="$1"
      fi
      shift
      ;;
  esac
done
```

**Path Resolution**:

# Function: Resolve AIWG installation path
resolve_aiwg_root() {
  # 1. Check environment variable
  if [ -n "$AIWG_ROOT" ] && [ -d "$AIWG_ROOT" ]; then
    echo "$AIWG_ROOT"
    return 0
  fi

  # 2. Check installer location (user)
  if [ -d ~/.local/share/ai-writing-guide ]; then
    echo ~/.local/share/ai-writing-guide
    return 0
  fi

  # 3. Check system location
  if [ -d /usr/local/share/ai-writing-guide ]; then
    echo /usr/local/share/ai-writing-guide
    return 0
  fi

  # 4. Check git repository root (development)
  if git rev-parse --show-toplevel &>/dev/null; then
    echo "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)"
    return 0
  fi

  # 5. Fallback to current directory
  echo "."
  return 1
}

**Resolve AIWG installation**:

```bash
AIWG_ROOT=$(resolve_aiwg_root)

if [ ! -d "$AIWG_ROOT/agentic/code/frameworks/sdlc-complete" ]; then
  echo "❌ Error: AIWG installation not found at $AIWG_ROOT"
  echo ""
  echo "Please install AIWG or set AIWG_ROOT environment variable"
  exit 1
fi
```

**Interactive Mode**:

If `--interactive` flag set, prompt user with strategic questions:

```bash
if [ "$INTERACTIVE" = true ]; then
  echo "# Flow Compliance Validation - Interactive Setup"
  echo ""
  echo "I'll ask 6 strategic questions to tailor this flow to your project's needs."
  echo ""

  read -p "Q1: What are your top priorities for this activity? " answer1
  read -p "Q2: What are your biggest constraints? " answer2
  read -p "Q3: What risks concern you most for this workflow? " answer3
  read -p "Q4: What's your team's experience level with this type of activity? " answer4
  read -p "Q5: What's your target timeline? " answer5
  read -p "Q6: Are there compliance or regulatory requirements? " answer6

  echo ""
  echo "Based on your answers, I'll adjust priorities, agent assignments, and activity focus."
  echo ""
  read -p "Proceed with these adjustments? (yes/no) " confirm

  if [ "$confirm" != "yes" ]; then
    echo "Aborting flow."
    exit 0
  fi

  # Synthesize guidance from answers
  GUIDANCE="Priorities: $answer1. Constraints: $answer2. Risks: $answer3. Team: $answer4. Timeline: $answer5."
fi
```

**Apply Guidance**:

Parse guidance for keywords and adjust execution:

```bash
if [ -n "$GUIDANCE" ]; then
  # Keyword detection
  FOCUS_SECURITY=false
  FOCUS_PERFORMANCE=false
  FOCUS_COMPLIANCE=false
  TIGHT_TIMELINE=false

  if echo "$GUIDANCE" | grep -qiE "security|secure|audit"; then
    FOCUS_SECURITY=true
  fi

  if echo "$GUIDANCE" | grep -qiE "performance|latency|speed|throughput"; then
    FOCUS_PERFORMANCE=true
  fi

  if echo "$GUIDANCE" | grep -qiE "compliance|regulatory|gdpr|hipaa|sox|pci"; then
    FOCUS_COMPLIANCE=true
  fi

  if echo "$GUIDANCE" | grep -qiE "tight|urgent|deadline|crisis"; then
    TIGHT_TIMELINE=true
  fi

  # Adjust agent assignments based on guidance
  ADDITIONAL_REVIEWERS=""

  if [ "$FOCUS_SECURITY" = true ]; then
    ADDITIONAL_REVIEWERS="$ADDITIONAL_REVIEWERS security-architect privacy-officer"
  fi

  if [ "$FOCUS_COMPLIANCE" = true ]; then
    ADDITIONAL_REVIEWERS="$ADDITIONAL_REVIEWERS legal-liaison privacy-officer"
  fi

  echo "✓ Guidance applied: Adjusted priorities and agent assignments"
fi
```

## Compliance Gap Severity Levels

### Critical Gap
**Definition**: Control missing or ineffective, high likelihood of audit failure or regulatory penalty

**Examples**:
- No encryption of regulated data (HIPAA PHI, PCI CHD)
- No access control on sensitive systems
- No audit logging for critical operations

**Remediation Timeline**: Immediate (within 7 days)
**Risk**: BLOCKS attestation, high risk of breach or penalty

### High Gap
**Definition**: Control partially implemented or insufficient evidence

**Examples**:
- Audit logging enabled but not monitored
- Encryption enabled but no key rotation
- Access control implemented but overly permissive

**Remediation Timeline**: Within 30 days
**Risk**: May block attestation, medium risk of audit finding

### Medium Gap
**Definition**: Control implemented but not fully compliant with framework

**Examples**:
- Policies documented but not reviewed annually
- Training completed but not tracked
- Evidence exists but not centralized

**Remediation Timeline**: Within 90 days
**Risk**: Minor audit finding, low risk of penalty

### Low Gap
**Definition**: Control effective but minor documentation or process improvement needed

**Examples**:
- Documentation version outdated but content current
- Evidence exists but retrieval process inefficient
- Process works but not formally documented

**Remediation Timeline**: Next compliance cycle (6-12 months)
**Risk**: Recommendation only, no penalty risk

## Control Types

### Preventive Controls
**Purpose**: Prevent security or compliance violations from occurring

**Examples**:

### Detective Controls
**Purpose**: Detect security or compliance violations after they occur

**Examples**:
- Audit logging (detect unauthorized actions)
- Intrusion detection system (detect attacks)
- Vulnerability scanning (detect misconfigurations)

**Testing Approach**: Simulate violation, verify detection and alerting

### Corrective Controls
**Purpose**: Correct security or compliance violations after detection

**Examples**:
- Incident response process (correct security incidents)
- Backup and recovery (correct data loss)
- Patch management (correct vulnerabilities)

**Testing Approach**: Simulate issue, verify correction process

### Administrative Controls
**Purpose**: Manage security and compliance through policies and procedures

**Examples**:
- Security policies (define acceptable use)
- Risk assessments (identify and manage risks)
- Security training (ensure user awareness)

**Testing Approach**: Review documentation, interview staff, check training records

### Physical Controls
**Purpose**: Protect physical assets and facilities

**Examples**:
- Badge access to data center
- CCTV monitoring

## Integration with Other Flows

### With Security Gate
- Compliance validation is part of security gate check
- Security controls map to compliance requirements
- Compliance gaps may block security gate

### With Risk Management
- Compliance gaps are risks
- Risk acceptance process applies to compliance gaps
- Compliance requirements inform risk assessment

### With Architecture Evolution
- Architecture changes may impact compliance
- Compliance requirements constrain architecture decisions
- ADRs document compliance-related decisions

### With Gate Checks
- Compliance validation is gate criterion for phase exit
- Compliance status reviewed at each gate
- Critical compliance gaps block gate passage

## Common Failure Modes

### Compliance as Checkbox Exercise
**Symptoms**: Focus on documentation, not control effectiveness

**Remediation**:
1. Test control effectiveness, not just design
2. Validate evidence with sampling
3. Focus on operational reality, not aspirational documentation
4. Involve auditor in process design

### Evidence Collection Scramble
**Symptoms**: Evidence collected last-minute before audit

**Remediation**:
1. Continuous evidence collection throughout year
2. Automated evidence collection where possible
3. Evidence repository with version control
4. Quarterly evidence review

### Compliance Fatigue
**Symptoms**: Team views compliance as burden, not value

**Remediation**:
1. Explain "why" behind compliance requirements
2. Automate compliance controls (shift-left compliance)
3. Integrate compliance into development workflow
4. Celebrate compliance achievements

### Siloed Compliance
**Symptoms**: Compliance officer works in isolation, gaps discovered late

**Remediation**:
1. Embed compliance in project team
2. Compliance review at each SDLC phase
3. Control owners accountable for compliance
4. Compliance metrics in project dashboard

### Audit Surprise
**Symptoms**: Audit findings that could have been identified earlier

**Remediation**:
1. Internal audit before external audit
2. Mock audits to identify gaps
3. Pre-audit checklist
4. Continuous compliance monitoring

## Success Criteria

This command succeeds when:
- [ ] All compliance requirements mapped to controls
- [ ] Audit evidence collected for all controls
- [ ] Gap analysis completed with severity assessment
- [ ] Critical and high gaps remediated or risk accepted
- [ ] Control effectiveness validated
- [ ] Compliance attestation signed by Executive Sponsor
- [ ] Compliance report generated with evidence index

## Error Handling

**Missing Compliance Framework**:
- Report: "Compliance framework {framework} not recognized"
- Action: "Use supported framework: sox, hipaa, gdpr, pci-dss, iso27001, fedramp, ccpa, nist"
- Recommendation: "For custom framework, create compliance requirements matrix manually"

**Incomplete Evidence**:
- Report: "{count} controls missing evidence"
- Action: "Collect evidence for all controls before attestation"
- Recommendation: "Assign control owners to collect evidence"

**Critical Gaps Not Remediated**:
- Report: "{count} critical gaps remain unremediated"
- Action: "Remediate critical gaps before attestation"
- Escalation: "Cannot attest compliance with critical gaps"

**Control Owner Not Assigned**:
- Report: "Control {control-id} has no assigned owner"
- Action: "Assign control owner before evidence collection"
- Recommendation: "Review control ownership in compliance matrix"
