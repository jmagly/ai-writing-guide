# SDLC Flow Commands Gap Analysis - Executive Summary

## Current State

**Existing Flows**: 6
**Coverage**: 40% (Inception + Construction iterations well-supported)

### What We Have
- **flow-concept-to-inception**: Complete Inception phase orchestration (7 steps to LOM gate)
- **flow-discovery-track**: Requirements refinement 1 iteration ahead
- **flow-delivery-track**: Test-driven implementation with quality gates
- **flow-iteration-dual-track**: Synchronized Discovery + Delivery workflow
- **flow-gate-check**: Automated phase/workflow gate validation
- **flow-handoff-checklist**: Phase transition validation

### What We're Missing
- **No Elaboration phase workflow** (Inception → Architecture Baseline)
- **No Transition phase workflow** (Construction → Production)
- **No production operations workflows** (deployment, monitoring, incidents)
- **No continuous improvement workflows** (retrospectives, evolution)

## Gap Analysis Results

### 18 Missing Flow Commands Identified

#### Critical Priority (3 flows)
Complete phase-to-phase transitions:

1. **flow-inception-to-elaboration**: LOM gate → ABM gate (architecture baseline)
2. **flow-elaboration-to-construction**: ABM gate → OCM gate (iterative development)
3. **flow-construction-to-transition**: OCM gate → PRM gate (production readiness)

#### High Priority (6 flows)
Production operations and risk management:

4. **flow-production-deployment**: Execute production deployment with validation
5. **flow-hypercare-monitoring**: 7-day intensive post-deployment monitoring
6. **flow-incident-response**: Production incident triage and resolution
7. **flow-risk-management**: Continuous risk monitoring across all phases
8. **flow-requirements-evolution**: Baseline management and traceability
9. **flow-security-hardening**: Continuous vulnerability management

#### Medium Priority (6 flows)
Quality and governance:

10. **flow-release-retrospective**: Post-release lessons learned
11. **flow-architecture-evolution**: Technical debt and refactoring management
12. **flow-test-automation**: Comprehensive test suite automation
13. **flow-performance-optimization**: Continuous performance monitoring
14. **flow-change-control**: Change Control Board workflow
15. **flow-compliance-validation**: GDPR, HIPAA, SOC2 compliance

#### Low Priority (3 flows)
Team coordination:

16. **flow-team-onboarding**: New team member onboarding
17. **flow-knowledge-transfer**: Structured handoff knowledge transfer
18. **flow-cross-team-coordination**: Multi-team dependency management

## Recommended Roadmap

### Phase 1: Critical Phase Transitions (Weeks 1-3)
**Goal**: Enable complete phase orchestration

- Week 1: flow-inception-to-elaboration
- Week 2: flow-elaboration-to-construction
- Week 3: flow-construction-to-transition

**Impact**: 100% phase coverage (Inception → Elaboration → Construction → Transition)

### Phase 2: Production Operations (Weeks 4-6)
**Goal**: Enable production deployment and support

- Week 4: flow-production-deployment
- Week 5: flow-hypercare-monitoring
- Week 6: flow-incident-response

**Impact**: Full production lifecycle support (cradle to grave)

### Phase 3: High-Priority Cross-Cutting (Weeks 7-9)
**Goal**: Enable continuous risk, requirements, and security

- Week 7: flow-risk-management
- Week 8: flow-requirements-evolution
- Week 9: flow-security-hardening

**Impact**: Complete risk and security management across lifecycle

### Phase 4-5: Quality, Governance, Coordination (Weeks 10-18)
**Goal**: Comprehensive quality, governance, and team support

- Weeks 10-15: Quality and governance flows (6 flows)
- Weeks 16-18: Team coordination flows (3 flows)

**Impact**: Enterprise-grade SDLC framework with full governance

## Key Insights

### Strengths of Current Implementation
- Excellent Inception phase coverage (concept → vision → business case → risks)
- Strong Construction iteration support (dual-track Discovery/Delivery)
- Comprehensive gate validation framework
- Well-defined handoff mechanisms

### Critical Gaps
1. **Elaboration Phase**: No workflow for architecture baseline, prototype, risk retirement
2. **Transition Phase**: No workflow for production deployment, ORR, support handover
3. **Operations**: No workflows for production monitoring, incidents, continuous improvement
4. **Cross-Cutting**: Risk management, requirements evolution, security hardening are manual

### Business Impact
- **Without gaps filled**: Teams can manage Inception and Construction but struggle with Elaboration, Transition, and Operations
- **With all gaps filled**: Complete cradle-to-grave automation from initial idea through production operations and continuous improvement

## Success Metrics

### Current Coverage
| Lifecycle Area | Coverage |
|----------------|----------|
| Inception | 100% |
| Elaboration | 0% |
| Construction | 80% |
| Transition | 0% |
| Operations | 0% |
| **Overall** | **40%** |

### Target Coverage (After Phase 1-3)
| Lifecycle Area | Coverage |
|----------------|----------|
| Inception | 100% |
| Elaboration | 100% |
| Construction | 100% |
| Transition | 100% |
| Operations | 100% |
| **Overall** | **100%** |

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate (Week 1)**: Implement flow-inception-to-elaboration
   - Unblocks Elaboration phase support
   - Enables architecture baseline workflow

2. **Short-term (Weeks 2-6)**: Complete Phase 1 and 2
   - Full phase orchestration (Inception → Elaboration → Construction → Transition)
   - Production deployment and operations support

3. **Medium-term (Weeks 7-18)**: Complete Phase 3-5
   - Risk, security, quality, governance, and team coordination
   - Enterprise-grade SDLC framework

## Conclusion

Current flow commands provide **excellent foundation** (40% coverage), but **18 additional flows** are needed for complete cradle-to-grave SDLC support.

**Priority 1**: Implement Critical flows (Weeks 1-3) to enable phase-to-phase orchestration.
**Priority 2**: Implement High-priority flows (Weeks 4-9) for production operations and cross-cutting concerns.

**Expected Outcome**: Teams can execute complete SDLC from initial concept through production operations using flow commands as automated playbooks, with full governance and quality controls.
