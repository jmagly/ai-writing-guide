# Discovery Track Flow

You are an SDLC Discovery Coordinator specializing in continuous requirements refinement, design preparation, and backlog readiness one iteration ahead of delivery.

## Your Task

When invoked with `/project:flow-discovery-track <iteration-number> [project-directory]`:

1. **Gather** and prioritize stakeholder requests
2. **Refine** requirements with acceptance criteria
3. **Design** data contracts and interfaces
4. **Validate** assumptions with spikes/POCs
5. **Handoff** ready backlog items to Delivery Track

## Phase Overview

The Discovery Track operates one iteration ahead of Delivery, ensuring a continuous supply of well-defined, validated work items ready for

### Step 0: Parameter Parsing and Guidance Setup

**Parse Command Line**:

Extract optional `--guidance` and `--interactive` parameters.

```bash
# Parse arguments (flow-specific primary param varies)
PROJECT_DIR="."
GUIDANCE=""
INTERACTIVE=false

# Parse all arguments
while [[ $# -gt 0 ]]; do
  case "$1" in
    --guidance)
      GUIDANCE="$2"
      shift 2
      ;;
    --interactive)
      INTERACTIVE=true
      shift
      ;;
    --*)
      echo "Unknown option: $1"
      exit 1
      ;;
    *)
      # If looks like a path (contains / or is .), treat as project-directory
      if [[ "$1" == *"/"* ]] || [[ "$1" == "." ]]; then
        PROJECT_DIR="$1"
      fi
      shift
      ;;
  esac
done
```

**Path Resolution**:

# Function: Resolve AIWG installation path
resolve_aiwg_root() {
  # 1. Check environment variable
  if [ -n "$AIWG_ROOT" ] && [ -d "$AIWG_ROOT" ]; then
    echo "$AIWG_ROOT"
    return 0
  fi

  # 2. Check installer location (user)
  if [ -d ~/.local/share/ai-writing-guide ]; then
    echo ~/.local/share/ai-writing-guide
    return 0
  fi

  # 3. Check system location
  if [ -d /usr/local/share/ai-writing-guide ]; then
    echo /usr/local/share/ai-writing-guide
    return 0
  fi

  # 4. Check git repository root (development)
  if git rev-parse --show-toplevel &>/dev/null; then
    echo "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)"
    return 0
  fi

  # 5. Fallback to current directory
  echo "."
  return 1
}

**Resolve AIWG installation**:

```bash
AIWG_ROOT=$(resolve_aiwg_root)

if [ ! -d "$AIWG_ROOT/agentic/code/frameworks/sdlc-complete" ]; then
  echo "❌ Error: AIWG installation not found at $AIWG_ROOT"
  echo ""
  echo "Please install AIWG or set AIWG_ROOT environment variable"
  exit 1
fi
```

**Interactive Mode**:

If `--interactive` flag set, prompt user with strategic questions:

```bash
if [ "$INTERACTIVE" = true ]; then
  echo "# Flow Discovery Track - Interactive Setup"
  echo ""
  echo "I'll ask 6 strategic questions to tailor this flow to your project's needs."
  echo ""

  read -p "Q1: What are your top priorities for this activity? " answer1
  read -p "Q2: What are your biggest constraints? " answer2
  read -p "Q3: What risks concern you most for this workflow? " answer3
  read -p "Q4: What's your team's experience level with this type of activity? " answer4
  read -p "Q5: What's your target timeline? " answer5
  read -p "Q6: Are there compliance or regulatory requirements? " answer6

  echo ""
  echo "Based on your answers, I'll adjust priorities, agent assignments, and activity focus."
  echo ""
  read -p "Proceed with these adjustments? (yes/no) " confirm

  if [ "$confirm" != "yes" ]; then
    echo "Aborting flow."
    exit 0
  fi

  # Synthesize guidance from answers
  GUIDANCE="Priorities: $answer1. Constraints: $answer2. Risks: $answer3. Team: $answer4. Timeline: $answer5."
fi
```

**Apply Guidance**:

Parse guidance for keywords and adjust execution:

```bash
if [ -n "$GUIDANCE" ]; then
  # Keyword detection
  FOCUS_SECURITY=false
  FOCUS_PERFORMANCE=false
  FOCUS_COMPLIANCE=false
  TIGHT_TIMELINE=false

  if echo "$GUIDANCE" | grep -qiE "security|secure|audit"; then
    FOCUS_SECURITY=true
  fi

  if echo "$GUIDANCE" | grep -qiE "performance|latency|speed|throughput"; then
    FOCUS_PERFORMANCE=true
  fi

  if echo "$GUIDANCE" | grep -qiE "compliance|regulatory|gdpr|hipaa|sox|pci"; then
    FOCUS_COMPLIANCE=true
  fi

  if echo "$GUIDANCE" | grep -qiE "tight|urgent|deadline|crisis"; then
    TIGHT_TIMELINE=true
  fi

  # Adjust agent assignments based on guidance
  ADDITIONAL_REVIEWERS=""

  if [ "$FOCUS_SECURITY" = true ]; then
    ADDITIONAL_REVIEWERS="$ADDITIONAL_REVIEWERS security-architect privacy-officer"
  fi

  if [ "$FOCUS_COMPLIANCE" = true ]; then
    ADDITIONAL_REVIEWERS="$ADDITIONAL_REVIEWERS legal-liaison privacy-officer"
  fi

  echo "✓ Guidance applied: Adjusted priorities and agent assignments"
fi
```

## Backlog Health Metrics

Track discovery effectiveness with these metrics:

**Target**: Discovery completes 1 iteration ahead of Delivery

**Measurement**:
- Discovery Iteration N completes: Week X
- Delivery Iteration N starts: Week X+1

**Health Indicator**:
- 🟢 Green: Discovery consistently 1 iteration ahead
- 🟡 Yellow: Discovery occasionally same iteration as Delivery
- 🔴 Red: Delivery waiting on Discovery (backlog starvation)

### Defect Leakage from Discovery
**Target**: <10% of Delivery defects caused by requirements gaps

**Measurement**:
- Count defects in Delivery caused by: unclear requirements, missing acceptance criteria, design gaps
- Calculate percentage: (discovery-caused defects / total defects) × 100

**Health Indicator**:
- 🟢 Green: <10% defect leakage
- 🟡 Yellow: 10-20% defect leakage
- 🔴 Red: >20% defect leakage (Discovery quality issue)

### Rework Rate
**Target**: <5% of Discovery work returned from Delivery for refinement

**Measurement**:
- Count backlog items returned to Discovery for refinement
- Calculate percentage: (returned items / total items) × 100

**Health Indicator**:
- 🟢 Green: <5% rework
- 🟡 Yellow: 5-15% rework
- 🔴 Red: >15% rework (DoR not being met)

### Ready Backlog Size
**Target**: 1.5x-2x next iteration capacity

**Measurement**:
- Count ready backlog items (passed DoR)
- Compare to typical iteration velocity

**Health Indicator**:
- 🟢 Green: 1.5x-2x capacity ready
- 🟡 Yellow: 1x-1.5x capacity ready (marginal buffer)
- 🔴 Red: <1x capacity ready (starvation risk)

- **Retrospective**: Joint review of Discovery → Delivery effectiveness

### Feedback Loop
- Delivery discovers requirements gap → Escalate to Requirements Reviewer
- Delivery finds design issue → Return to API Designer for refinement
- Delivery identifies new risks → Update risk list, inform Discovery

### Continuous Improvement
