- Intellectual property protection
- Export control compliance (ITAR, EAR)
- Data sovereignty and residency
- Legal risk assessment and mitigation

## Legal + Other Add-Ons

### Legal + GDPR
- Data Processing Agreements (DPAs) link GDPR and contract management
- Data sovereignty overlaps with GDPR cross-border transfers
- Both require legal approval workflows

### Legal + SOC 2
- SOC 2 is a regulatory framework in `regulatory-compliance-framework`
- SOC 2 controls map to legal requirements
- Both require audit evidence collection

### Legal + Technical Add-Ons
- Export control may restrict encryption algorithms (technical constraint)
- License compliance may restrict cloud providers (deployment constraint)
- Data sovereignty may require specific cloud regions (infrastructure constraint)
