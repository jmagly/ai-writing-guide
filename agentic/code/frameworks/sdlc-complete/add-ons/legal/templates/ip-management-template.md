## 2 Patent Portfolio Management

> Identify inventions, evaluate patentability, file patent applications, and manage patent portfolio.

### 2.1 Invention Disclosure Process

**When to Disclose**:
- Novel technical solution to problem
- Non-obvious improvement over existing approaches
- Potentially valuable competitive advantage
- Before public disclosure (publication, presentation, demo, sale)

**Invention Disclosure Form**: [Link to form or embed]

**Required Information**:
- Invention title and summary
- Problem solved
- Solution description (technical details)
- Advantages over prior art
- Inventors (names, contributions)
- Prior art known to inventors
- Public disclosure status (none, planned, already disclosed)
- Business value and competitive advantage

**Submission Process**:
1. **Inventor completes disclosure form**: Submit to Legal Liaison
2. **Initial review** (5 business days): Legal Liaison assesses completeness
3. **Patent committee review** (30 days): Engineering Lead, Product Manager, Patent Attorney
4. **Decision**: File patent / Maintain as trade secret / Publish defensively / No action

### 2.2 Patent Filing Strategy

**Patentability Criteria**:
- **Novel**: Not disclosed in prior art (patents, publications, products)
- **Non-obvious**: Not obvious to person skilled in the art
- **Useful**: Has practical utility
- **Patentable subject matter**: Not abstract idea, law of nature, or natural phenomenon (US restrictions)

**Filing Decision Factors**:

| Factor | Weight | Consideration |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Technical novelty** | High | Is invention truly novel and non-obvious? |
| **Business value** | High | Does invention provide competitive advantage? Revenue potential? |
| **Patent landscape** | High | Are competitors patenting in this space? Can we design around existing patents? |
| **Cost** | Medium | Filing and maintenance costs ($15K-$50K per patent) |
| **Enforceability** | Medium | Can we detect and enforce infringement? |
| **Alternative protection** | Medium | Is trade secret protection better? (no expiration, but no exclusivity) |

**Filing Strategy Options**:
- **Provisional patent**: Low-cost placeholder (1 year to file full patent), ~$3K
- **Non-provisional US patent**: Full patent application, ~$15K-$25K
- **PCT international application**: Single application for multiple countries, ~$30K-$50K + national phase costs
- **Defensive publication**: Publish to create prior art (prevents others from patenting), $0

### 2.3 Patent Portfolio Inventory

| Patent ID | Title | Inventors | Filing Date | Status | Jurisdiction | Annual Maintenance | Expiration Date |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| US-2024-001 | [Title] | [Names] | [yyyy-mm-dd] | [Provisional/Pending/Granted] | United States | $1,600 (yr 3.5), $3,600 (yr 7.5), $7,400 (yr 11.5) | [yyyy-mm-dd] |
| EP-2024-002 | [Title] | [Names] | [yyyy-mm-dd] | [Pending/Granted] | European Patent | Varies by country | [yyyy-mm-dd] |
| PCT-2024-003 | [Title] | [Names] | [yyyy-mm-dd] | [International phase] | Multiple (PCT) | N/A (national phase fees) | N/A (12-30 mo to national phase) |

**Portfolio Value**: [Total estimated value, competitive advantages]

**Annual Maintenance Budget**: [Total patent maintenance costs]

### 2.4 Freedom to Operate (FTO) Analysis

**Purpose**: Assess risk of infringing third-party patents before product launch

**When to Conduct FTO**:
- Before launching new product feature
- Before entering new market
- When competitor patents detected in product space
- When receiving patent infringement threats

**FTO Process**:
1. **Identify product features**: Technical characteristics, functionality
2. **Patent landscape search**: Search patent databases (USPTO, EPO, Google Patents) for relevant patents
3. **Claim analysis**: Compare product features to patent claims
4. **Risk assessment**: Likelihood of infringement, patent enforceability, patent owner litigation history
5. **Mitigation options**: Design around, license, invalidate patent (prior art), accept risk

**FTO Report Template**:

| Patent | Patent Owner | Relevant Claims | Infringement Risk | Mitigation | Recommendation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| US1234567 | [Owner] | Claims 1-3 (predictive analytics method) | Low (prior art found) | [Prior art challenge / Design around] | Proceed (low risk) |
| US7654321 | [Owner] | Claims 5-7 (data encryption technique) | Medium (novel patent) | [License / Design around] | Design around (cost < license) |

**FTO Cost**: $25K-$100K per analysis (patent attorney fees)

**FTO Approval**: Patent Attorney sign-off required before high-risk feature launch

### 2.5 Patent Licensing

**Inbound Licensing** (licensing others' patents):
- **Trigger**: FTO analysis identifies infringement risk
- **Negotiation**: Contact patent owner, negotiate license terms
- **Terms**: Royalty rate, fields of use, territory, exclusivity, sublicensing rights
- **Cost**: Varies widely ($10K-$1M+ annually depending on patent value)

**Outbound Licensing** (licensing company patents to others):
- **Trigger**: Third party requests license, or proactive licensing program
- **Strategy**: Generate revenue, cross-licensing, standards participation
- **Terms**: Royalty rate, minimum guarantees, audit rights

**Patent Cross-Licensing**:
- **Purpose**: Mutual license exchange to avoid litigation
- **Terms**: Each party licenses patents to other, often royalty-free
- **Benefit**: Freedom to operate without patent lawsuits

## 3 Trademark Portfolio Management

> Register and protect trademarks to safeguard brand identity.

### 3.1 Trademark Identification

**Trademarks**:
- Company name: [Name]
- Product names: [List]
- Logos: [Descriptions or images]
- Slogans/taglines: [List]

**Trademark Types**:
- **Word mark**: Text-only (e.g., "Apple")
- **Design mark**: Logo, stylized text
- **Combined mark**: Word + logo
- **Sound mark**: Audio brand (rare)

### 3.2 Trademark Registration Strategy

**Why Register**:
- Exclusive right to use trademark in registered class
- Nationwide protection (US) or multi-country (EU, Madrid Protocol)
- Legal presumption of ownership
- Stronger enforcement (damages, injunctions)

**Registration Process**:
1. **Clearance search**: Search USPTO/EUIPO databases for conflicting marks
2. **Application filing**: File trademark application (~$250-$750 per class)
3. **Examination** (6-12 months): Trademark office reviews for conflicts, descriptiveness
4. **Publication** (30 days): Third parties can oppose
5. **Registration** (if no opposition): Certificate issued
6. **Maintenance**: File maintenance documents (US: 5-6 years, 9-10 years, then every 10 years)

**International Registration**:
- **Madrid Protocol**: Single application for multiple countries (~$1,000 + country fees)
- **EU Trademark**: Single registration for all EU countries (~€1,000)

### 3.3 Trademark Portfolio Inventory

| Trademark | Type | Jurisdiction | Class(es) | Filing Date | Registration Number | Status | Renewal Date |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Company Name] | Word mark | United States | 9 (software), 42 (SaaS) | [yyyy-mm-dd] | [Reg #] | [Pending/Registered] | [yyyy-mm-dd] |
| [Logo] | Design mark | European Union | 9, 42 | [yyyy-mm-dd] | [Reg #] | [Pending/Registered] | [yyyy-mm-dd] |

**Nice Classification** (trademark classes):
- **Class 9**: Computer software (downloadable)
- **Class 35**: Business services
- **Class 42**: Software as a Service (SaaS)

### 3.4 Trademark Enforcement

**Monitoring**: Use trademark watch services to detect infringing uses

**Enforcement Actions**:
- **Cease-and-desist letter**: Demand infringer stop use
- **Opposition**: Oppose confusingly similar trademark applications
- **Cancellation**: Petition to cancel infringing registered trademark
- **Litigation**: Sue for trademark infringement (last resort)

**Domain Name Protection**:
- Register key domain names (.com, .net, .io, country TLDs)
- Monitor domain registrations for typosquatting
- Use UDRP (Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy) to recover infringing domains

### 3.5 Trademark Usage Guidelines

**Internal Guidelines**:
- Always use ® symbol for registered trademarks
- Use ™ symbol for unregistered trademarks
- Use trademark as adjective, not noun or verb (e.g., "Acme® software", not "the Acme")
- Maintain distinctive appearance (capitalization, font)

**Third-Party Usage**:
- Require permission for trademark use by partners, press
- Provide trademark usage guidelines (approved logo files, color codes)
- Monitor and enforce against unauthorized use

## 4 Copyright Management

> Protect copyrightable works and manage copyright ownership.

### 4.1 Copyrightable Works

**Project Copyrights**:
- Source code (software)
- Documentation (user guides, API docs, technical specs)
- Website content (text, graphics)
- Marketing materials (brochures, videos, presentations)
- UI/UX designs (wireframes, mockups)

**Copyright Protection**: Automatic upon creation (no registration required in US), but registration enables statutory damages and attorney's fees

### 4.2 Copyright Ownership

**Ownership by Default**:
- **Employees**: Company owns works created within scope of employment (work-for-hire)
- **Contractors**: Contractor owns unless written assignment agreement in place
- **Open source contributors**: Contributor retains copyright unless CLA assigns to project

**Ensuring Company Ownership**:
- **Employee agreements**: Include IP assignment clause (all inventions and works belong to company)
- **Contractor agreements**: Include work-for-hire and assignment clauses
- **Contributor License Agreements**: Require contributors to license or assign copyrights

### 4.3 Copyright Registration

**When to Register**:
- Before litigation (registration required to sue in US)
- Before public release (early registration enables statutory damages for infringement)
- For high-value works (where litigation risk or value justifies cost)

**Registration Process**:
1. **Prepare deposit copy**: Source code, documentation, or other work
2. **File application**: Online at copyright.gov (~$65 per work)
3. **Examination**: Copyright Office reviews (4-8 months)
4. **Certificate issued**: Legal presumption of ownership

**Project Copyright Registrations**:

| Work | Description | Registration Number | Filing Date | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Product] v1.0 Source Code | [Language, LOC] | [Reg #] | [yyyy-mm-dd] | [Pending/Registered] |
| [Product] User Guide | [Description] | [Reg #] | [yyyy-mm-dd] | [Pending/Registered] |

**Registration Cost**: ~$65 per work

### 4.4 Copyright Notices

**Format**: © [Year] [Copyright Owner]. All rights reserved.

**Placement**: Source code headers, documentation footers, website footers

**Example**:

```
Copyright © 2024 Acme Corporation. All rights reserved.

This software is proprietary and confidential. Unauthorized use,
duplication, or distribution is strictly prohibited.
```

**Open Source Projects**: Use open source license header (e.g., Apache 2.0, MIT)

### 4.5 Open Source Licensing

**If Project is Open Source**:
- **Choose license**: MIT, Apache 2.0, GPL, etc. (see `license-compliance-template.md`)
- **Include license file**: LICENSE.txt in repository root
- **Copyright notices**: Preserve copyright notices in all files
- **Contributor License Agreement**: Require contributors to license their contributions

**Reference**: See `license-compliance-template.md` for full open source licensing guidance

## 5 Trade Secret Protection

> Identify and protect confidential business information that derives value from secrecy.

### 5.1 Trade Secret Identification

**What Qualifies as Trade Secret**:
- Not generally known or readily ascertainable
- Derives economic value from secrecy
- Subject to reasonable secrecy measures

**Project Trade Secrets**:

| Trade Secret | Description | Economic Value | Secrecy Measures | Owner |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Algorithm X] | [Proprietary algorithm for...] | Competitive advantage, difficult to reverse-engineer | Restricted source access, code obfuscation, NDAs | Engineering |
| [Customer list] | [Key enterprise customers with pricing] | Revenue impact, competitive intelligence | Access-controlled CRM, NDAs | Sales |
| [Roadmap] | [Product roadmap 2-3 years out] | Competitive timing advantage | Need-to-know access, confidential designation | Product |

### 5.2 Trade Secret vs. Patent Strategy

**Trade Secret Advantages**:
- No expiration (lasts as long as secret maintained)
- No disclosure requirement (patent applications disclose invention)
- No filing or maintenance costs

**Trade Secret Disadvantages**:
- No exclusivity (others can independently discover or reverse-engineer)
- No legal protection if disclosed or independently discovered
- Difficult to enforce (must prove misappropriation)

**Decision Factors**:

| Factor | Choose Patent | Choose Trade Secret |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Detectability | Difficult to detect infringement | Easy to detect by examining product |
| Reverse engineering | Easy to reverse-engineer | Difficult to reverse-engineer |
| Disclosure impact | Public disclosure acceptable | Public disclosure destroys value |
| Duration | 20 years sufficient | Indefinite protection needed |
| Enforcement | Strong exclusivity needed | Independent discovery acceptable |

**Example**: Coca-Cola formula = trade secret (no expiration, difficult to reverse-engineer). Pharmaceutical drug = patent (reverse-engineer via chemical analysis, need exclusivity).

### 5.3 Trade Secret Protection Measures

#### 5.3.1 Technical Controls

- **Access controls**: Restrict access to need-to-know (RBAC, least privilege)
- **Encryption**: Encrypt trade secret data at rest and in transit
- **Code obfuscation**: Obfuscate compiled code to prevent reverse-engineering
- **Watermarking**: Embed watermarks to trace leaks
- **Monitoring**: Log access to trade secrets, alert on anomalous access

#### 5.3.2 Legal Controls

- **Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs)**: All employees, contractors, partners sign NDAs
- **Non-Compete Agreements**: Prevent employees from joining competitors (where enforceable)
- **Confidentiality provisions in contracts**: Customer, vendor, partner contracts include confidentiality clauses
- **Trade secret legends**: Mark documents "Confidential" or "Trade Secret"

#### 5.3.3 Physical Controls

- **Secure facilities**: Badge access, visitor logs, no visitor access to trade secret areas
- **Clean desk policy**: No trade secret documents left unattended
- **Secure disposal**: Shred confidential documents, wipe hard drives

### 5.4 Trade Secret Incident Response

**Incident Scenarios**:
- Employee shares trade secret with competitor
- Contractor publishes trade secret in public repository
- Trade secret disclosed in public presentation

**Response Process**:
1. **Contain**: Remove public disclosure if possible, revoke access
2. **Assess damage**: What was disclosed? To whom? Economic impact?
3. **Legal action**: Send cease-and-desist, file misappropriation lawsuit if warranted
4. **Strengthen controls**: Prevent recurrence (enhanced access controls, training)
5. **Patent filing** (if possible): If trade secret now public, file patent before prior art

**Legal Remedies**:
- **Injunction**: Court order to stop use of trade secret
- **Damages**: Lost profits or unjust enrichment
- **Attorney's fees**: If willful misappropriation

## 6 IP Ownership and Assignment

> Ensure company owns all IP created by employees, contractors, and contributors.

### 6.1 Employee Invention Agreements

**Purpose**: Assign employee inventions to company

**Key Clauses**:
- **Pre-invention assignment**: All inventions made during employment belong to company
- **Work-for-hire**: All works created are company property
- **Disclosure obligation**: Employees must disclose inventions to company
- **Assistance obligation**: Employees must assist with patent filings, even after employment ends

**State-Specific Restrictions** (US):
- **California Labor Code § 2870**: Employees retain inventions made on own time, without company resources, outside company business
- **Other states**: Similar carve-outs (Delaware, Illinois, Minnesota, etc.)

**Recommended Approach**: Use state-compliant invention assignment agreement, carve out personal inventions per state law

**Employee Agreement Status**: [ ] All employees signed / [ ] Some unsigned (list names)

### 6.2 Contractor IP Assignment

**Problem**: By default, contractors own their work (no work-for-hire doctrine for independent contractors)

**Solution**: Written agreement assigning all IP to company

**Key Clauses**:
- **Work-for-hire**: To extent work qualifies as work-for-hire, it is company property
- **Assignment**: To extent not work-for-hire, contractor assigns all IP to company
- **Moral rights waiver**: Contractor waives moral rights (attribution, integrity) where permitted

**Recommended Practice**: Include IP assignment in contractor agreement, signed BEFORE work begins

**Contractor Agreement Status**:

| Contractor | Agreement Signed? | Date | IP Assignment Clause? | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Name] | [ ] Yes / [ ] No | [yyyy-mm-dd] | [ ] Yes / [ ] No | [Compliant/Non-compliant] |

**Non-Compliant Contractors**: If contractor worked without IP assignment, negotiate retroactive assignment or discontinue use of their work

### 6.3 Contributor License Agreements (CLAs)

**Purpose**: Ensure open source contributors license or assign IP to project

**CLA Types**:
- **Individual CLA**: Contributor licenses/assigns their contributions
- **Corporate CLA**: Company licenses/assigns employee contributions
- **Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)**: Lightweight alternative (contributors certify they have rights to contribute)

**CLA vs. DCO**:
- **CLA**: Stronger legal protection, requires signing agreement, higher friction
- **DCO**: Lightweight (Signed-off-by line in commit), less friction, may be sufficient for permissive licenses

**Project CLA**:
- [ ] CLA required: [Individual/Corporate/Both]
- [ ] DCO required: [Yes/No]
- [ ] CLA text: [Link to CLA document]
- [ ] CLA tracking: [Manual / CLA bot (e.g., CLA Assistant)]

**CLA Enforcement**:
- **Manual**: Contributors sign CLA via DocuSign, tracked in spreadsheet
- **Automated**: CLA bot checks GitHub PRs, blocks merge if CLA not signed

### 6.4 Customer IP Provisions

**Contractual IP Terms**:
- **Custom development**: Define who owns custom work (customer or company)
- **Pre-existing IP**: Company retains all pre-existing IP, platform IP
- **License grants**: Customer receives license to use company IP (perpetual, non-exclusive)
- **Customer data**: Customer retains ownership of their data

**Recommended Terms**:
- Company owns platform and reusable components
- Customer owns custom features specific to their business
- Company receives license to reuse non-confidential learnings from custom work

**Contract Review**: Ensure customer contracts align with IP policy, escalate deviations to Legal Liaison

## 7 IP Portfolio Reporting

> Track IP assets and report portfolio status.

### 7.1 IP Portfolio Summary

| IP Type | Count | Status | Annual Cost |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Patents | [Granted/Pending] | [Count] | $[Maintenance + filing fees] |
| Trademarks | [Registered/Pending] | [Count] | $[Renewal fees] |
| Copyrights | [Registered] | [Count] | $[Registration fees] |
| Trade Secrets | [Active] | [Count] | $[Protection costs] |
| **Total** | **[Total]** | - | **$[Total annual cost]** |

### 7.2 Quarterly IP Review

**Review Frequency**: Quarterly

**Review Participants**: Legal Liaison, Patent Attorney, Engineering Lead, Product Manager

**Review Agenda**:
1. New invention disclosures (past quarter)
2. Patent filing decisions (pending disclosures)
3. Patent filing status updates (applications in progress)
4. Trademark registrations (new filings, status updates)
5. IP risks (FTO concerns, infringement threats)
6. Budget review (IP spending vs. budget)

**Action Items**: Patent filing decisions, FTO analyses, trademark filings, risk mitigations

## Agent Notes

- File provisional patents early (1 year grace period to file full patent) to secure priority date
- Conduct FTO analysis BEFORE launching patent-sensitive features (ML, crypto, hardware)
- Ensure ALL contractors sign IP assignment agreements BEFORE starting work
- Trade secrets require continuous secrecy measures (access controls, NDAs), loss of secrecy = loss of protection
- Trademark clearance searches prevent costly rebranding if conflicts found late
- Employee invention agreements must comply with state laws (California § 2870, etc.)
- Copyright registration required before litigation in US, so register high-value works early
- Verify Automation Outputs entry is satisfied before signaling completion
