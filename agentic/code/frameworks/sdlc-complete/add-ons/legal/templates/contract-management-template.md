- Monitor SLA compliance proactively: Detect SLA breaches before they occur, not after
- Automate renewal alerts: Set reminders at T-180, T-90, T-60, T-30 days to prevent lapses
- Verify vendor certifications: Don't assume vendor compliance, verify annually
- Coordinate with Legal Liaison on all contract reviews and renewals
- Verify Automation Outputs entry is satisfied before signaling completion
