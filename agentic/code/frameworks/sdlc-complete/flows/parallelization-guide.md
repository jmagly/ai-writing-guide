# Parallelization Guide

## Slicing Principles

- Prefer small, independent cards per concern (requirements, design, code, tests)
- Minimize cross-file edits to reduce merge conflicts
- Limit each card to 1â€“2 hours of focused work

## Common Slices

- Requirements: use-case brief, acceptance card, data contract
- Design: interface contract, component design, sequence sketch
- Code: task slice with tests, integration test spec
- Security: threat scenario, control implementation card
- Reliability: SLI card, alert/runbook entry, chaos experiment card

## Handoffs and Traceability

- Link cards into the traceability matrix
- Use the handoff checklist for transitions
