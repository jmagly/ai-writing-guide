- Automation Inputs: Approved personas, business use-case spec, stakeholder walkthroughs
- Automation Outputs: `use-case-<id>.md` with main and alternate flows

## Completion Checklist

- All flows (main and alternate) enumerated with pre/postconditions
- Non-functional requirements and business rules linked
- Open issues and assumptions clearly documented

## Agent Notes

- Keep language testableâ€”statements should translate to acceptance criteria.
- Sync updates with QA to ensure tests reflect the latest flows.
- Verify the Automation Outputs entry is satisfied before signaling completion.
