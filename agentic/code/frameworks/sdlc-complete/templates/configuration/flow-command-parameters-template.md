# Flow Command Parameters Template

**Purpose**: Standard parameter handling for all SDLC flow commands

## Standard Parameters

All flow commands in `agentic/code/frameworks/sdlc-complete/commands/flow-*.md` should support:

### Required Parameters
- `<primary-parameter>`: Command-specific required parameter (varies by flow)

### Optional Parameters
- `[project-directory]`: Path to project root (default: `.`)
- `--guidance "text"`: Free-form strategic guidance to influence execution
- `--interactive`: Enable interactive mode with strategic questions

## Parameter Usage Patterns

### --guidance Parameter

**Purpose**: Allow users to provide strategic direction upfront rather than redirecting post-generation.

**Format**: `--guidance "free-form text describing priorities, constraints, or focus areas"`

**Examples**:
```bash
# Security focus
/project:flow-architecture-evolution --guidance "Focus on security architecture first, SOC2 audit in 3 months"

# Performance focus
/project:flow-performance-optimization --guidance "User-facing latency critical, aim for <100ms p95"

# Team skill gaps
/project:flow-inception-to-elaboration --guidance "Team has limited DevOps experience, need extra infrastructure support"

# Business constraints
/project:flow-change-control --guidance "Regulatory approval required, prioritize compliance impact analysis"
```

**Implementation**:
```markdown
## Parameter Handling

### Step 0: Parse Guidance (if provided)

If `--guidance` parameter present:

1. **Extract Strategic Context**:
   ```bash
   GUIDANCE="$1"  # Captured from command invocation
   ```

2. **Influence Execution**:
   - **Priority Adjustments**: If guidance mentions priorities (security, performance, cost, speed), weight activities accordingly
   - **Focus Areas**: If guidance specifies domain focus (compliance, scale, team skills), emphasize relevant templates and agents
   - **Risk Awareness**: If guidance mentions risks or constraints, add to risk considerations
   - **Agent Selection**: If guidance implies specialized needs, assign domain-specific agents

3. **Document Guidance**:
   ```bash
   # Add to artifact metadata
   cat >> .aiwg/working/{artifact}/metadata.json <<EOF
   {
     "guidance-provided": "$GUIDANCE",
     "guidance-influence": {
       "priorities-adjusted": true,
       "focus-areas": ["security", "compliance"],
       "additional-agents": ["security-architect", "legal-liaison"]
     }
   }
   EOF
   ```

**Example Influence Logic**:
- Guidance mentions "security" → Add Security Architect to reviewers, prioritize security templates
- Guidance mentions "tight timeline" → Reduce optional artifacts, focus on critical path
- Guidance mentions "compliance" → Add Legal Liaison and Privacy Officer to reviewers
- Guidance mentions "team skills gap" → Add mentoring focus to agent assignments
```

### --interactive Parameter

**Purpose**: Prompt user with 5-10 strategic questions to gather context before execution.

**Format**: `--interactive` (boolean flag)

**Examples**:
```bash
# Interactive mode prompts before execution
/project:flow-architecture-evolution --interactive

# Can combine with guidance (guidance pre-fills answers)
/project:flow-inception-to-elaboration --interactive --guidance "Focus on security"
```

**Implementation**:
```markdown
### Step 0: Interactive Mode (if enabled)

If `--interactive` flag present:

1. **Display Flow Context**:
   ```markdown
   # {Flow Name} - Interactive Setup

   **Purpose**: {brief description of what this flow accomplishes}
   **Typical Duration**: {estimated time}
   **Key Outputs**: {main artifacts generated}

   **Context**: I'll ask 5-10 strategic questions to tailor this flow to your project's needs.
   Your answers will influence agent assignments, template selection, and activity priorities.
   ```

2. **Ask Strategic Questions** (5-10 questions, flow-specific):

   **Question Categories**:
   - **Priority/Focus**: What matters most? (Security, Performance, Cost, Speed, Quality)
   - **Constraints**: What are your main constraints? (Timeline, Budget, Team Skills, Compliance)
   - **Risk Awareness**: What keeps you up at night about this project?
   - **Team Context**: What are your team's strengths and gaps?
   - **Domain Specifics**: {flow-specific domain questions}
   - **Success Criteria**: How will you measure success for this activity?

   **Example Question Flow** (Architecture Evolution):
   ```
   Q1: What's driving this architecture change? (New requirements, performance issues, tech debt, scaling needs)

   Q2: What are your top priorities for the architecture? (Rank: Security, Performance, Maintainability, Cost)

   Q3: What are your biggest constraints? (Timeline pressure, team skills, budget, compliance requirements)

   Q4: What architectural risks concern you most? (Data migration, backward compatibility, integration complexity)

   Q5: How mature is your current architecture documentation? (Comprehensive, Outdated, Minimal, None)

   Q6: What's your team's experience level with architecture reviews? (Expert, Intermediate, Learning, New)

   Q7: Are there compliance or regulatory requirements? (If yes, specify: GDPR, HIPAA, SOC2, PCI-DSS, etc.)

   Q8: What's your target timeline for this architecture evolution? (Weeks, Months, Ongoing)
   ```

3. **Synthesize Guidance**:
   ```markdown
   Based on your answers, I'll:
   - Prioritize: {derived priorities from Q2}
   - Focus on: {key constraints and risks from Q3-Q4}
   - Assign agents: {recommended agents based on team gaps from Q6}
   - Adapt templates: {template adjustments based on maturity from Q5}
   - Address compliance: {compliance focus from Q7}
   - Adjust timeline: {activity scoping based on Q8}

   Proceed with these adjustments? (yes/no)
   ```

4. **Convert to Guidance String** (for internal use):
   ```bash
   # Synthesize answers into guidance string
   GUIDANCE="Priorities: Security>Performance>Cost. Constraints: Tight timeline (3 months), team skills gap in DevOps. Risks: Data migration complexity, backward compatibility. Compliance: SOC2 audit required. Architecture maturity: Minimal docs, need comprehensive."

   # Continue with guidance-influenced execution
   ```

**Question Design Guidelines**:
- **Provide Context**: Explain why you're asking each question
- **Offer Examples**: Show example answers to guide users
- **Allow Skip**: Let users skip questions with "unsure" or "N/A"
- **Keep Focused**: 5-10 questions max, prioritize most impactful
- **Be Specific**: Ask about this flow's domain, not generic project questions
- **Show Influence**: Explain how answers will affect execution
```

## Integration Pattern for Existing Flow Commands

### Frontmatter Update

**Before**:
```yaml
---
description: Execute {Flow Name} with automated coordination
argument-hint: <primary-param> [project-directory]
---
```

**After**:
```yaml
---
description: Execute {Flow Name} with automated coordination
argument-hint: <primary-param> [project-directory] [--guidance "text"] [--interactive]
---
```

### Command Documentation Update

Add to "Your Task" section:

```markdown
## Your Task

When invoked with `/project:flow-{name} <primary-param> [options]`:

**Options**:
- `[project-directory]`: Path to project root (default: `.`)
- `--guidance "text"`: Strategic guidance to influence execution (priorities, constraints, focus areas)
- `--interactive`: Enable interactive mode with 5-10 strategic questions

**Execution Flow**:
1. **Step 0**: Parse guidance (if provided) or prompt interactively (if flag set)
2. **Step 1-N**: Execute flow-specific steps with guidance-influenced decisions
3. **Final Step**: Generate outputs reflecting guidance priorities
```

### Parameter Parsing Logic

Add as first step in flow:

```markdown
## Execution Steps

### Step 0: Parameter Parsing and Guidance Setup

**Parse Command Line**:
```bash
# Extract parameters
PRIMARY_PARAM="$1"
PROJECT_DIR="${2:-.}"
GUIDANCE=""
INTERACTIVE=false

# Parse optional flags
shift 2  # Skip primary and project-dir
while [[ $# -gt 0 ]]; do
  case "$1" in
    --guidance)
      GUIDANCE="$2"
      shift 2
      ;;
    --interactive)
      INTERACTIVE=true
      shift
      ;;
    *)
      echo "Unknown option: $1"
      exit 1
      ;;
  esac
done
```

**Handle Interactive Mode**:
```bash
if [ "$INTERACTIVE" = true ]; then
  # Display flow context
  echo "# {Flow Name} - Interactive Setup"
  echo ""
  echo "**Purpose**: {description}"
  echo ""
  echo "I'll ask 5-10 strategic questions to tailor this flow."
  echo ""

  # Ask questions (flow-specific)
  read -p "Q1: {question}? " answer1
  read -p "Q2: {question}? " answer2
  # ... (5-10 questions)

  # Synthesize guidance
  GUIDANCE="Priorities: $answer2. Constraints: $answer3. Focus: $answer1."
  echo ""
  echo "Synthesized guidance: $GUIDANCE"
  echo ""
  read -p "Proceed with these adjustments? (yes/no) " confirm
  if [ "$confirm" != "yes" ]; then
    echo "Aborting flow."
    exit 0
  fi
fi
```

**Apply Guidance**:
```bash
if [ -n "$GUIDANCE" ]; then
  # Parse guidance for keywords
  if echo "$GUIDANCE" | grep -qi "security"; then
    FOCUS_SECURITY=true
  fi
  if echo "$GUIDANCE" | grep -qi "performance"; then
    FOCUS_PERFORMANCE=true
  fi
  # ... (add more keyword detection)

  # Adjust agent assignments
  if [ "$FOCUS_SECURITY" = true ]; then
    REVIEWERS="$REVIEWERS security-architect privacy-officer"
  fi

  # Document guidance influence
  mkdir -p .aiwg/working/{artifact}
  cat >> .aiwg/working/{artifact}/metadata.json <<EOF
{
  "guidance-provided": "$GUIDANCE",
  "guidance-keywords": ["security", "performance"],
  "adjusted-agents": ["security-architect", "privacy-officer"]
}
EOF
fi
```
```

## Template Repository Path Configuration

All template references should use the configurable AIWG_ROOT path resolution:

```bash
# Source path resolution function (once per flow)
AIWG_ROOT=$(resolve_aiwg_root)  # From aiwg-config-template.md

# Use in template paths
TEMPLATE=$AIWG_ROOT/agentic/code/frameworks/sdlc-complete/templates/{category}/{template-name}.md

# Error handling
if [ ! -f "$TEMPLATE" ]; then
  echo "Error: Template not found: $TEMPLATE"
  echo "Please ensure AIWG is installed or set AIWG_ROOT environment variable"
  exit 1
fi
```

## Summary

**For each flow command**:
1. Update frontmatter with `[--guidance "text"] [--interactive]` in argument-hint
2. Add Step 0: Parameter Parsing and Guidance Setup
3. Add flow-specific strategic questions for interactive mode
4. Apply guidance keywords to influence agent assignments, template selection, priorities
5. Document guidance influence in artifact metadata
6. Use configurable AIWG_ROOT for template paths (not hardcoded ~/.local/share/ai-writing-guide)

**Benefits**:
- Users express direction upfront (vs redirecting post-generation)
- Consistent parameter handling across all flows
- Interactive mode lowers barrier for new users
- Guidance parameter enables power users to streamline
- Agent assignments adapt to project context
- Template selection responds to priorities and constraints
