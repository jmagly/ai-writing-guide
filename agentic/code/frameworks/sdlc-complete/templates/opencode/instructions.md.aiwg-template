# AIWG SDLC Framework Instructions

This file provides project-specific instructions for AI agents using the AIWG SDLC Framework.

## Framework Overview

The AI Writing Guide (AIWG) SDLC Framework provides structured software development lifecycle management through specialized agents and workflows.

## Using AIWG Agents

### Invoking Agents

Use `@agent-name` to invoke specialized SDLC agents:

```
@security-architect Review the authentication implementation for vulnerabilities
@test-engineer Generate unit tests for the user service
@code-reviewer Review this PR for code quality and best practices
```

### Available Agent Categories

**Planning & Design**:
- `@requirements-analyst` - Requirements gathering and analysis
- `@architecture-designer` - System architecture decisions
- `@api-designer` - API contract definitions

**Implementation**:
- `@software-implementer` - Production code implementation
- `@test-engineer` - Test development
- `@code-reviewer` - Code review

**Quality & Security**:
- `@security-architect` - Security architecture
- `@security-auditor` - Vulnerability assessment
- `@performance-engineer` - Performance optimization

**Documentation**:
- `@technical-writer` - Technical documentation
- `@documentation-synthesizer` - Multi-source consolidation

## Using AIWG Commands

Commands are invoked via `/command-name`:

```
/project-status
/flow-gate-check elaboration
/security-gate
/generate-tests
```

## SDLC Phases

1. **Inception** - Problem validation, vision, risks
2. **Elaboration** - Requirements, architecture baseline
3. **Construction** - Implementation, testing
4. **Transition** - Deployment, UAT, handover

## Artifact Management

All SDLC artifacts are stored in `.aiwg/`:

- `intake/` - Project intake forms
- `requirements/` - User stories, use cases
- `architecture/` - SAD, ADRs
- `planning/` - Phase plans
- `testing/` - Test strategy, plans
- `security/` - Threat models
- `deployment/` - Deployment plans

## Best Practices

1. **Use appropriate agents** - Match agent expertise to task
2. **Follow workflows** - Use `/flow-*` commands for structured transitions
3. **Maintain traceability** - Link requirements to code to tests
4. **Document decisions** - Create ADRs for significant choices
5. **Validate quality** - Run security and test gates regularly
