# AGENTS.md - OpenCode Integration

This file provides project-specific guidance for OpenCode's AI coding agent.

<!-- AIWG SDLC Framework Integration -->

## AIWG SDLC Framework

This project uses the AIWG SDLC Framework for software development lifecycle management.

### Available Agents

AIWG agents are deployed to `.opencode/agent/` and can be invoked via `@agent-name`:

**Planning & Architecture**:
- `@architecture-designer` - System architecture and design decisions
- `@requirements-analyst` - Requirements gathering and analysis
- `@api-designer` - API design and contract definitions

**Implementation**:
- `@software-implementer` - Production code implementation
- `@test-engineer` - Test development and coverage
- `@code-reviewer` - Code review and quality

**Security & Quality**:
- `@security-architect` - Security architecture and threat modeling
- `@security-auditor` - Security review and vulnerability assessment
- `@performance-engineer` - Performance optimization

**Documentation**:
- `@technical-writer` - Technical documentation
- `@architecture-documenter` - Architecture documentation
- `@documentation-synthesizer` - Multi-source documentation consolidation

### Available Commands

AIWG commands are deployed to `.opencode/command/` and can be invoked via `/command`:

- `/project-status` - Current project status and next steps
- `/flow-gate-check <phase>` - Validate phase gate criteria
- `/security-gate` - Run security validation
- `/generate-tests` - Generate test suite

### SDLC Artifacts Location

All SDLC artifacts are stored in `.aiwg/`:

```
.aiwg/
├── intake/        # Project intake forms
├── requirements/  # User stories, use cases
├── architecture/  # SAD, ADRs
├── planning/      # Phase plans
├── risks/         # Risk register
├── testing/       # Test strategy
├── security/      # Threat models
├── deployment/    # Deployment plans
├── working/       # Temporary (safe to delete)
└── reports/       # Generated reports
```

### Workflow Patterns

**Multi-agent review**: For comprehensive artifact review, invoke multiple agents in parallel using the `aiwg-orchestrator` tool.

**Phase transitions**: Use `/flow-inception-to-elaboration`, `/flow-elaboration-to-construction`, etc. for guided phase transitions.

**Continuous validation**: Use `/flow-security-review-cycle`, `/flow-test-strategy-execution` for ongoing quality assurance.
