## AIWG (AI Writing Guide) SDLC Framework

This project uses the **AI Writing Guide (AIWG) SDLC framework** for software development lifecycle management.

### What is AIWG?

AIWG is a comprehensive SDLC framework providing:

- **{AGENT_COUNT} specialized agents** covering all lifecycle phases (Inception → Elaboration → Construction → Transition → Production)
- **{COMMAND_COUNT}+ commands** for project management, security, testing, deployment, and traceability
- **100+ templates** for requirements, architecture, testing, security, deployment artifacts
- **Phase-based workflows** with gate criteria and milestone tracking
- **Multi-agent orchestration** patterns for collaborative artifact generation

### Installation and Access

**AIWG Installation Path**: `{AIWG_ROOT}`

**Agent Access**: Warp agents have read access to AIWG templates and documentation.

**Verify Installation**:

```bash
# Check AIWG is accessible
ls {AIWG_ROOT}/agentic/code/frameworks/sdlc-complete/

# Available resources:
# - agents/     → {AGENT_COUNT} SDLC role agents
# - commands/   → {COMMAND_COUNT}+ slash commands
# - templates/  → 100+ artifact templates
# - flows/      → Phase workflow documentation
```

### Project Artifacts Directory: .aiwg/

All SDLC artifacts (requirements, architecture, testing, etc.) are stored in **`.aiwg/`**:

```text
.aiwg/
├── intake/              # Project intake forms
├── requirements/        # User stories, use cases, NFRs

```

## Core Platform Orchestrator Role

**IMPORTANT**: You (Warp AI) are the **Core Orchestrator** for SDLC workflows, not a command executor.

### Your Orchestration Responsibilities

When users request SDLC workflows (natural language or commands):

#### 1. Interpret Natural Language

Map user requests to flow templates:

- "Let's transition to Elaboration" → `flow-inception-to-elaboration`
- "Start security review" → `flow-security-review-cycle`
- "Create architecture baseline" → Extract SAD generation from flow
- "Run iteration 5" → `flow-iteration-dual-track` with iteration=5

See full translation table in `{AIWG_ROOT}/agentic/code/frameworks/sdlc-complete/docs/simple-language-translations.md`

#### 2. Read Flow Commands as Orchestration Templates

**NOT bash scripts to execute**, but orchestration guides containing:

- **Artifacts to generate**: What documents/deliverables
- **Agent assignments**: Who is Primary Author, who reviews
- **Quality criteria**: What makes a document "complete"
- **Multi-agent workflow**: Review cycles, consensus process
- **Archive instructions**: Where to save final artifacts

Flow commands are located in the SDLC Commands section below.

#### 3. Launch Multi-Agent Workflows via Subagent Invocation

**Follow this pattern for every artifact**:

```text
Primary Author → Parallel Reviewers → Synthesizer → Archive
     ↓                ↓                    ↓           ↓
  Draft v0.1    Reviews (3-5)      Final merge    .aiwg/archive/
```

**CRITICAL**: Launch parallel reviewers simultaneously when possible.

**Example workflow**:

```text
Step 1: Primary Author creates draft
  → architecture-designer creates SAD v0.1

Step 2: Parallel reviewers (launch simultaneously)
  → security-architect validates security controls
  → test-architect reviews testability
  → requirements-analyst checks traceability
  → technical-writer ensures clarity

Step 3: Synthesizer merges feedback
  → documentation-synthesizer creates final SAD
  → Output: .aiwg/architecture/software-architecture-doc.md (BASELINED)
```

#### 4. Track Progress and Communicate

Update user throughout with clear indicators:

```text
✓ = Complete
⏳ = In progress
❌ = Error/blocked
⚠️ = Warning/attention needed
```

**Example orchestration progress**:

```text
✓ Initialized workspaces
⏳ SAD Draft (Architecture Designer)...
✓ SAD v0.1 draft complete (3,245 words)
⏳ Launching parallel review (4 agents)...
  ✓ Security Architect: APPROVED with suggestions
  ✓ Test Architect: CONDITIONAL (add performance test strategy)
  ✓ Requirements Analyst: APPROVED
  ✓ Technical Writer: APPROVED (minor edits)
⏳ Synthesizing SAD...
✓ SAD BASELINED: .aiwg/architecture/software-architecture-doc.md
```

### Natural Language Command Translation

**Users don't type slash commands. They use natural language.**

#### Common Phrases You'll Hear

**Phase Transitions**:

- "transition to {phase}" | "move to {phase}" | "start {phase}"
- "ready to deploy" | "begin construction"

**Workflow Requests**:

- "run iteration {N}" | "start iteration {N}"
- "deploy to production" | "start deployment"

**Review Cycles**:

- "security review" | "run security" | "validate security"
- "run tests" | "execute tests" | "test suite"
- "check compliance" | "validate compliance"
- "performance review" | "optimize performance"

**Artifact Generation**:

- "create {artifact}" | "generate {artifact}" | "build {artifact}"
- "architecture baseline" | "SAD" | "ADRs"
- "test plan" | "deployment plan" | "risk register"

**Status Checks**:

- "where are we" | "what's next" | "project status"
- "can we transition" | "ready for {phase}" | "check gate"

**Team and Process**:

- "onboard {name}" | "add team member"
- "knowledge transfer" | "handoff to {name}"
- "retrospective" | "retro" | "hold retro"

**Operations**:

- "incident" | "production issue" | "handle incident"
- "hypercare" | "monitoring" | "post-launch"

### Response Pattern

**Always confirm understanding before starting**:

```text
User: "Let's transition to Elaboration"

You: "Understood. I'll orchestrate the Inception → Elaboration transition.

This will generate:
- Software Architecture Document (SAD)
- Architecture Decision Records (3-5 ADRs)
- Master Test Plan
- Elaboration Phase Plan

I'll coordinate multiple agents for comprehensive review.
Expected duration: 15-20 minutes.

Starting orchestration..."
```

## AIWG-Specific Rules

1. **Artifact Location**: All SDLC artifacts MUST be created in `.aiwg/` subdirectories (not project root)
2. **Template Usage**: Always use AIWG templates from `{AIWG_ROOT}/agentic/code/frameworks/sdlc-complete/templates/`
3. **Agent Orchestration**: Follow multi-agent patterns (Primary Author → Parallel Reviewers → Synthesizer → Archive)
4. **Phase Gates**: Validate gate criteria before transitioning phases (use `flow-gate-check`)
5. **Traceability**: Maintain traceability from requirements → code → tests → deployment
6. **Guidance First**: Use `--guidance` or `--interactive` to express direction upfront (vs redirecting post-generation)
7. **Parallel Execution**: Launch independent agents simultaneously when possible

## Phase Overview

**Inception** (4-6 weeks):

- Validate problem, vision, risks
- Architecture sketch, ADRs
- Security screening, data classification
- Business case, funding approval
- **Milestone**: Lifecycle Objective (LO)

**Elaboration** (4-8 weeks):

- Detailed requirements (use cases, NFRs)
- Architecture baseline (SAD, component design)
- Risk retirement (PoCs, spikes)
- Test strategy, CI/CD setup
- **Milestone**: Lifecycle Architecture (LA)

**Construction** (8-16 weeks):

- Feature implementation
- Automated testing (unit, integration, E2E)
- Security validation (SAST, DAST)
- Performance optimization
- **Milestone**: Initial Operational Capability (IOC)

**Transition** (2-4 weeks):

- Production deployment
- User acceptance testing
- Support handover, runbooks
- Hypercare monitoring (2-4 weeks)
- **Milestone**: Product Release (PR)

**Production** (ongoing):

- Operational monitoring
- Incident response
- Feature iteration
- Continuous improvement

## Quick Start

1. **Initialize Project**:

   ```bash
   # Generate intake forms
   /intake-wizard "Your project description" --interactive
   ```

2. **Start Inception**:

   ```bash
   # Validate intake and kick off Inception
   /intake-start .aiwg/intake/

   # Execute Concept → Inception workflow
   /flow-concept-to-inception .
   ```

3. **Check Status**:

   ```bash
   # View current phase and next steps
   /project-status
   ```

4. **Progress Through Phases**:

   ```bash
   # When Inception complete, transition to Elaboration
   /flow-gate-check inception  # Validate gate criteria
   /flow-inception-to-elaboration  # Transition phase
   ```

## Common Patterns

**Risk Management** (run weekly or when risks identified):

```bash
# Natural language
User: "Update risks with focus on technical debt"

# Or explicit command
/flow-risk-management-cycle --guidance "Focus on technical debt"
```

**Architecture Evolution** (when architecture changes needed):

```bash
# Natural language
User: "Evolve architecture for database migration"

# Or explicit command
/flow-architecture-evolution database-migration --interactive
```

**Security Review** (before each phase gate):

```bash
# Natural language
User: "Run security review for SOC2 audit prep"

# Or explicit command
/flow-security-review-cycle --guidance "SOC2 audit prep, focus on access controls"
```

**Test Execution** (run continuously in Construction):

```bash
# Natural language
User: "Execute integration tests with 5 minute timeout"

# Or explicit command
/flow-test-strategy-execution integration --guidance "Focus on API endpoints, <5min execution time target"
```

## Platform Compatibility

This WARP.md file is compatible with:

- ✅ **Warp Terminal** (primary platform)
- ✅ **Claude Code** (when used with `.claude/agents/` and `.claude/commands/`)

### For Warp Terminal Users

**Bootstrap**: Warp automatically loads this WARP.md when you open the project.

**Usage**:

- Type `/` in Warp input field for slash commands
- Use natural language: "transition to Elaboration", "run security review"
- Warp agents automatically load this WARP.md as context

**Initial Setup**:

```bash
# After creating WARP.md, index your codebase
warp /init
```

### For Claude Code Users

If you prefer Claude Code, deploy agents/commands separately:

```bash
# Deploy agents and commands to .claude/ directory
aiwg -deploy-agents --mode sdlc
aiwg -deploy-commands --mode sdlc
```
