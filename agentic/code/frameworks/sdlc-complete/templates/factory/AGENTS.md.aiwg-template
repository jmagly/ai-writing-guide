<!-- AIWG SDLC Framework Integration -->

## AIWG SDLC Framework

This project uses the **AI Writing Guide (AIWG) SDLC framework** with Factory AI droids for comprehensive software development lifecycle management.

### What is AIWG?

AIWG provides:
- **53 specialized droids** covering all SDLC phases (Inception → Elaboration → Construction → Transition → Production)
- **42+ commands** for project management, security, testing, deployment, and traceability
- **100+ templates** for requirements, architecture, testing, security, and deployment artifacts
- **Phase-based workflows** with gate criteria and milestone tracking
- **Multi-agent orchestration** for collaborative artifact generation

### Using AIWG Droids

**Direct Invocation:**
```text
"Use requirements-analyst to review this user story"
"Ask security-architect to evaluate authentication design"
"Have test-engineer create test plan for payment flow"
```

**Natural Language Orchestration:**

Factory automatically maps natural language to droids:

```text
"Start security review"        → security-architect + security-gatekeeper + security-auditor
"Create architecture baseline" → architecture-designer + reviewers + synthesizer
"Generate test plan"           → test-architect + test-engineer
"Deploy to production"         → deployment-manager + reliability-engineer
"Run iteration 5"              → Entire iteration workflow
```

**Multi-Agent Workflows:**

Factory handles parallel execution automatically:

**Pattern: Primary Author → Parallel Reviewers → Synthesizer → Archive**

```text
You: "Create comprehensive SAD for microservices platform"

Factory orchestrates:
1. architecture-designer creates draft
2. Parallel review (launched simultaneously):
   - security-architect validates security controls
   - test-architect checks testability  
   - requirements-analyst verifies traceability
   - technical-writer ensures clarity
3. documentation-synthesizer merges all feedback
4. Final SAD saved to .aiwg/architecture/software-architecture-doc.md
```

### Project Artifacts (.aiwg/)

### Configuration

**AIWG Installation:** `~/.local/share/ai-writing-guide`

**Verify Installation:**
```bash
ls ~/.local/share/ai-writing-guide/agentic/code/frameworks/sdlc-complete/

# Available resources:
# - agents/     → SDLC role agents (source)
# - commands/   → Slash commands (source)
# - templates/  → 100+ artifact templates
# - flows/      → Phase workflow documentation
```

**Deployed Resources:**
```bash
ls .factory/droids/     # 53 SDLC droids
ls .factory/commands/   # 42+ flow commands
ls .aiwg/               # SDLC artifacts
```

### Customizing Droids

Edit any droid to adjust behavior:

```bash
code .factory/droids/architecture-designer.md
```

**Customize:**
- `model`: Change to faster/slower model (opus, sonnet, haiku)
- `tools`: Restrict to specific tools (remove Execute for safety)
- System prompt: Adjust behavior, style, focus areas

**Example:**
```yaml
---
name: architecture-designer
description: Creates software architecture documents
model: claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929  # Changed from opus for speed/cost
tools: ["Read", "LS", "Grep", "Glob", "Edit", "Create"]  # Removed Execute
---
```

**Natural Language Support:** Factory AI understands natural language for SDLC workflows. You don't need to memorize commands—just describe what you want:

- "Where are we in the SDLC?" → project-status
- "Start security review" → flow-security-review-cycle  
- "Create architecture baseline" → Multi-agent SAD generation
- "Ready to deploy?" → flow-gate-check + deployment readiness

**Tip:** Run `"Where are we?"` anytime to get current phase, progress, and next steps.
