## AIWG SDLC Framework

**53 SDLC droids** in `.factory/droids/` | **42+ commands** in `.factory/commands/`

### Quick Start

```bash
# Intake & Planning
/project:intake-wizard "Project description"     # Generate intake
/project:intake-from-codebase .                  # Analyze codebase

# Phase Workflows
/project:flow-inception-to-elaboration           # Transition phases
/project:flow-security-review-cycle              # Security review
/project:flow-test-strategy-execution            # Run tests
/project:project-status                          # Current phase
```

### Key Droids by Category

**Planning:** intake-coordinator, requirements-analyst, system-analyst, product-strategist  
**Architecture:** architecture-designer, api-designer, cloud-architect  
**Security:** security-architect, security-gatekeeper, security-auditor  
**Testing:** test-engineer, test-architect, accessibility-specialist  
**Operations:** devops-engineer, reliability-engineer, deployment-manager, incident-responder  
**Documentation:** technical-writer, documentation-synthesizer  
**Quality:** code-reviewer, performance-engineer, database-optimizer, debugger  
**Specialized:** legacy-modernizer, api-documenter, traceability-manager, executive-orchestrator

*Full list: `ls .factory/droids/`*

### Usage

**Direct:** `/project:architecture-designer "Create SAD"`  
**Natural:** `"Start security review"` (Factory orchestrates)  
**Multi-Agent:** `"Create SAD with review"` (parallel execution)

### Project Artifacts

All SDLC artifacts in `.aiwg/`:
- `intake/` - Project intake forms
- `requirements/` - User stories, use cases
- `architecture/` - SAD, ADRs, diagrams
- `testing/` - Test plans and results
- `security/` - Threat models, reviews
- `deployment/` - Deployment plans, runbooks

### Phase Workflows

**Inception** → Validate vision, risks, initial architecture  
**Elaboration** → Detailed requirements, architecture baseline  
**Construction** → Feature implementation, testing, security validation  
**Transition** → Production deployment, UAT, hypercare  

Common commands:
- `/project:flow-inception-to-elaboration`
- `/project:flow-security-review-cycle`
- `/project:flow-risk-management-cycle`
- `/project:flow-gate-check <phase>`
- `/project:project-health-check`

### Configuration

**AIWG Installation:** `~/.local/share/ai-writing-guide`  
**Verify:** `ls ~/.local/share/ai-writing-guide/agentic/code/frameworks/sdlc-complete/`

### Resources

- **AIWG Repo:** https://github.com/jmagly/ai-writing-guide
- **Factory Quick Start:** `~/.local/share/ai-writing-guide/docs/integrations/factory-quickstart.md`
- **Templates:** `~/.local/share/ai-writing-guide/agentic/code/frameworks/sdlc-complete/templates/`
- **Flows:** `.factory/commands/flow-*.md`

### Troubleshooting

**Droids not found:** `ls .factory/droids/` (should show 53 files)  
**Commands not found:** `ls .factory/commands/` (should show 42+ files)  
**Redeploy:** `aiwg -deploy-agents --provider factory --mode sdlc --deploy-commands --force`
