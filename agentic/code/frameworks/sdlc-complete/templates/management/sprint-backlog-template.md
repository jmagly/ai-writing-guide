## Purpose

The sprint backlog is the set of product backlog items selected for this sprint, plus the plan for delivering them and achieving the sprint goal. It is a living artifact that the team updates daily as they learn more about the work.

**Key Principles**:

- **Team Commitment**: Team collectively commits to sprint goal and backlog
- **Self-Organizing**: Team decides how to accomplish the work
- **Transparent**: Visible to entire team and stakeholders
- **Dynamic**: Updated daily as work emerges and understanding deepens
- **Goal-Focused**: All work connects to sprint goal

## Sprint Goal

### Goal Statement

**Sprint Goal**: [One-sentence description of what this sprint will achieve]

**Example**: "Enable users to search and filter job listings by location, salary, and experience level with <2 second response time."

### Why This Goal Matters

**Business Value**: [What business outcome this sprint delivers]

**User Impact**: [How this sprint improves user experience or capabilities]

**Technical Foundation**: [Infrastructure or architecture enabled by this sprint]

### Success Criteria

This sprint is successful if:

- [ ] [Measurable outcome 1]

## Capacity Planning

### Team Capacity

| Team Member | Role | Availability (%) | Hours/Day | Days This Sprint | Total Hours | Allocated Hours | Buffer |
|-------------|------|------------------|-----------|------------------|-------------|-----------------|--------|
| Alex | Frontend Dev | 80% | 6.4h | 10 | 64h | 58h | 6h |
| Casey | Backend Dev | 100% | 8h | 10 | 80h | 72h | 8h |
| Jordan | QA Engineer | 90% | 7.2h | 10 | 72h | 65h | 7h |
| Morgan | Fullstack Dev | 75% | 6h | 10 | 60h | 54h | 6h |

**Total Team Capacity**: 276 hours
**Total Allocated**: 249 hours
**Total Buffer**: 27 hours (10% buffer)

### Capacity Adjustments

**Planned Time Off**:

- Casey: Out Oct 20 (1 day) - already reflected in availability

**Meetings & Ceremonies**:

- Daily standups: 15 min/day Ã— 10 days = 2.5h per person
- Sprint planning: 2h (already completed)
- Sprint review: 1h (end of sprint)
- Sprint retrospective: 1h (end of sprint)
- Backlog refinement: 2h
- Total ceremony time: 6.5h per person = 26h team total

**Support Rotation**:

- On-call support rotation: 4h per person per sprint
- Production incident buffer: 8h team total

**Net Development Capacity**: 276h - 26h (ceremonies) - 16h (support) = 234h

**Commitment vs. Capacity**: 249h allocated / 234h capacity = 106% utilization
**Risk Assessment**: Slightly over-committed, monitor daily for scope adjustment

## Daily Tracking

### Burndown Chart Data

| Date | Remaining Story Points | Remaining Hours | Notes |
|------|------------------------|-----------------|-------|
| Oct 10 (Day 1) | 13 | 120h | Sprint started |
| Oct 11 (Day 2) | 12 | 112h | US-043 progressing well |
| Oct 12 (Day 3) | 12 | 108h | Blocked on API integration |

| Oct 18 (Day 9) | - | - | Forecast: 7 points |
| Oct 19 (Day 10) | - | - | Target: 0 points |

## Sprint Ceremonies

### Daily Standup (15 minutes)

**When**: Every day, same time
**Who**: Development team (mandatory), Product Owner (optional), Scrum Master (facilitator)

**Format** (each person answers):

1. What did I complete yesterday?
2. What will I work on today?
3. Any blockers or impediments?

**Output**: Updated sprint backlog, identified blockers escalated

### Sprint Review (1 hour)

**When**: Last day of sprint
**Who**: Team, Product Owner, Stakeholders

**Agenda**:

1. Sprint goal recap (5 min)
2. Demo completed stories (30 min)
3. Review incomplete work (10 min)
4. Stakeholder feedback (10 min)
5. Update product backlog based on feedback (5 min)

**Output**: Product Owner accepts or rejects stories, backlog updated

### Sprint Retrospective (1 hour)

**When**: After sprint review
**Who**: Development team, Scrum Master

**Agenda**:

1. What went well? (15 min)
2. What could be improved? (15 min)
3. What will we commit to improve next sprint? (20 min)
4. Review previous retrospective action items (10 min)

**Output**: 1-3 actionable improvements for next sprint

## Risk and Dependency Management

### Sprint Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation | Owner |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|-------|
| API vendor decision delayed | Medium | High - blocks US-044 | Parallelize with alternate vendor POC | Product Owner |
| Over-committed sprint (106% capacity) | High | Medium | Monitor daily, descope US-045 if needed | Scrum Master |
| Key team member out sick | Low | High | Pair programming, knowledge sharing | All |

### Dependencies

**External Dependencies**:

- Location API vendor selection (blocks US-044) - decision by Oct 16
- Design approval for search UI (blocks US-042 integration) - approval by Oct 13

**Internal Dependencies**:

- US-044 depends on US-042 completion (API must be ready)
- DEBT-012 should complete before US-045 (refactoring enables cleaner implementation)

## Metrics and Reporting

### Sprint Metrics

- **Velocity**: Story points completed (target: 13, forecast: 11-13)
- **Commitment Accuracy**: % of committed stories completed (target: >80%)

- **Defect Leakage**: Bugs found in production from this sprint (target: 0 critical)
- **Team Happiness**: Self-reported on 1-5 scale (target: >3.5)

### Status Summary (End of Sprint)

## Automation Guidance

**What to Automate**:

- Burndown chart generation from task status updates
- WIP limit alerts when exceeded
- Velocity calculation from completed story points
- Cycle time tracking from status transitions
- Sprint report generation (metrics, completion rates)
- Blocker notifications to stakeholders
- Daily standup reminders and meeting notes

**What to Keep Manual**:

- Sprint goal definition
- Story commitment decisions (team consensus)
- Daily standup discussions
- Impediment resolution strategies
- Definition of Done validation (requires judgment)
- Sprint review demo and feedback
- Retrospective facilitation and action items

## Template Customization

**For Kanban Teams**:

- Remove sprint boundaries, track continuous flow
- Replace sprint goal with monthly objectives
- Focus on cycle time and throughput instead of velocity
- Track cumulative flow instead of burndown
- Remove sprint ceremonies, keep daily standup and retrospectives

**For Solo Developers**:

- Simplify to personal task list with priorities
- Skip daily standup, use daily journal
- Focus on task completion, not story points
- Weekly review replaces sprint review
- Monthly retrospective replaces sprint retrospective

**For Remote/Distributed Teams**:

- Record daily standups asynchronously (written updates)
- Use virtual whiteboard for sprint board
- Schedule sprint ceremonies across time zones
- Over-communicate blockers in chat channels
- Add "time zone coverage" to capacity planning
