# Media Curator Framework Overview

The Media Curator framework enables AI agents to build, curate, and maintain
comprehensive media collections. It handles the full lifecycle from
type-flexible assessment through acquisition, organization, verification,
transcription where needed, research handoff, and multi-platform export.

## Common Use Cases

- Audit an existing archive, identify missing metadata, and create a cleanup plan.
- Research an artist, venue, creator, or event series before acquiring material.
- Acquire media from approved sources, then tag and verify the collection.
- Prepare transcripts, playlists, exports, or research handoffs from a curated archive.

## Design Philosophy

### Issue-Driven Development

This framework emerged from a real prototype: cataloging a large artist discography with mixed official, unofficial,
live, and archival material. The agents, commands, and skills reflect patterns from that field test.

### Quality Over Quantity

Not all media is worth collecting. The framework applies multi-dimensional quality scoring (audio, video, uniqueness) with configurable thresholds. Phone recordings are rejected by default, but "legendary" content (historically significant, only known recording) bypasses quality gates.

### Classification by Production Context

A key field-test learning: classify media by how it was produced (studio, live, broadcast), not how it sounds (acoustic, electric). A stripped-down studio recording is still a studio recording.

### Type-Flexible Entry

Unknown or mixed media starts with assess-and-plan rather than an audio-only
path. The framework selects music/discography handling only when the request,
metadata, filenames, or sources show that the archive is music-centered. See
`type-flexible-curation.md` for the recorded routing decision.

### Integrity First

Every archive includes self-verifying SHA-256 checksums and W3C PROV-compliant provenance tracking. Bit rot detection is built in, not bolted on.

## Next Step

Deploy the framework with `aiwg use media-curator`, then ask your assistant to assess one existing media folder and
produce an acquisition, metadata, and verification plan before downloading or rewriting files.
