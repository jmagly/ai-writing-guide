# aiwg-utils Rules Reference

Core enforcement rules deployed with every AIWG installation. These rules apply automatically based on context — you do not invoke them explicitly.

---

## subagent-scoping

**Priority**: HIGH
**Full rule**: `@$AIWG_ROOT/agentic/code/addons/aiwg-utils/rules/subagent-scoping.md`

### What It Enforces

Each subagent receives exactly one focused task with minimal context. Constraints:

- Prompt budget: under 20% of context window per subagent
- Delegation depth: no chains deeper than 2 levels (orchestrator → agent; not orchestrator → agent → agent)
- Parallelism: spawn many focused subagents over few overloaded ones
- When `AIWG_CONTEXT_WINDOW` is set: concurrent parallel count must respect the budget limit

### When It Applies

Task delegation, subagent spawning, parallel dispatch, orchestrator fan-out.

### Why It Matters

An overloaded subagent — one given 10 tasks and a large context dump — produces worse results than three focused subagents each handling one task. Token-efficient subagent design also reduces cost in proportion to how well scoping is applied.

### Example: Correct vs Incorrect

```
# Incorrect: one subagent with too much
Task(agent, "Analyze the authentication module, write tests,
fix any bugs, update documentation, and check for security issues")

# Correct: parallel focused subagents
Task(code-reviewer, "Review auth module for bugs and security issues")
Task(test-engineer, "Write unit tests for auth module")
Task(technical-writer, "Update auth module documentation")
```

## instruction-comprehension

**Priority**: HIGH
**Full rule**: `@$AIWG_ROOT/agentic/code/addons/aiwg-utils/rules/instruction-comprehension.md`

### What It Enforces

Before acting on any user request:
1. Fully parse all instructions
2. Extract prohibitions first (what NOT to do)
3. Extract requirements (what to do)
4. Extract preferences (how to do it)
5. Track multi-part requests to full completion

On failure: re-read original instructions instead of guessing or retrying with variations.

On long tasks: periodically recheck against original requirements to detect drift.

**Absolute prohibition**: Never override user preferences with "best practices." If a user specifies a pattern, use it.

### When It Applies

Every user request. Critical for multi-part tasks, specification compliance, and correction handling.

### Example: Drift Detection

If implementing feature X and a test fails on attempt 2, the rule requires re-reading the original spec rather than weakening the test or removing the validation to make progress.

## research-before-decision

**Priority**: HIGH  
**Full rule**: `@$AIWG_ROOT/agentic/code/addons/aiwg-utils/rules/research-before-decision.md`

### What It Enforces

Research first; act second. The execution pattern:

```
IDENTIFY  → What decision needs to be made?
SEARCH    → What existing code/docs/patterns are relevant?
EXTRACT   → What do those sources tell me?
REASON    → Given the evidence, what is the right choice?
ACT       → Implement the decision
VERIFY    → Confirm the result is correct
```

**Whack-a-mole detection**: If an action fails, diagnose the root cause before retrying. Retrying with random variations without diagnosis is prohibited.

**Read error messages completely**: They frequently contain the answer.

**Check existing patterns first**: Before creating a new implementation, check whether the project already has one.

### When It Applies

API usage, configuration changes, dependency selection, error diagnosis, import resolution, any technical decision.

## native-ux-tools

**Priority**: HIGH  
**Full rule**: `@$AIWG_ROOT/agentic/code/addons/aiwg-utils/rules/native-ux-tools.md`

### What It Enforces

Use platform-native interaction tools for questions. For Claude Code, this means using `AskUserQuestion` rather than generating plain text with a question in it. One question per interaction turn.

Fallback: if native tools are unavailable, use formatted Markdown question blocks.

### When It Applies

Interactive commands (any command with `--interactive` flag), decision gates, user confirmations, intake wizards.

### Platform Support

The rule includes a capability matrix defining which tool to use on each of the 8 supported platforms. Always check tool availability before invoking.

---

## tool-quota

**Priority**: HIGH
**Full rule**: `@$AIWG_ROOT/agentic/code/addons/aiwg-utils/rules/tool-quota.md`

### What It Enforces

Agents track tool calls per session, stop repeated failing calls, and honor declared quotas:

```yaml
tool_quota:
  Bash: 10
  WebFetch: 5
  defaults: 20
loop_detection:
  same_call_window: 5
  max_retries: 3
```

Default behavior when no agent-specific quota exists:

- Same failing call retries: 3
- Similar calls in a rolling window: 5
- Total calls to one tool in a focused session: 30
- High-cost external tool calls: 10

When a quota would be exceeded, the agent stops and reports what was tried, what was learned, why more calls are needed, and the narrow next action.

### When It Applies

Tool-heavy sessions, unattended bots, shell retry loops, external fetch loops, and any agent definition with `tool_quota` or `loop_detection`.

### Example: Quickbooksbot

Quickbooksbot receives a vague "why are March numbers wrong?" request. It may inspect known accounting files and integration status, but after three equivalent missing-token or permission failures it must stop, summarize the blocker, and ask for the missing export or credential instead of continuing tool retries.

---

## escalation-discipline

**Priority**: HIGH
**Full rule**: `@$AIWG_ROOT/agentic/code/addons/aiwg-utils/rules/escalation-discipline.md`

### What It Enforces

Agents summarize before using a model above their declared default tier:

```
Need: what is hard or uncertain
Escalation: target tier and why the default tier is insufficient
Next: the bounded task the higher tier will handle
```

Tier 3 requires explicit human confirmation. Unattended bots may not auto-escalate to Tier 3; they must ask, stop with a summary, or queue the request for a supervised agent.

Agent definitions may override defaults:

```yaml
escalation:
  unattended: true
  max_auto_tier: 1
  summary_required: true
  premium_requires_confirmation: true
```

### When It Applies

Model-tier routing, budget-sensitive agents, unattended bots, high-impact legal/financial/medical/security work, and user requests for deep, debug, or thorough work.

### Interaction with Human Authorization

Escalation confirmation is a human-authorization gate. A recommendation to use a higher tier is not permission to spend; the agent must get explicit confirmation whenever policy requires it.

### Example: Quickbooksbot

Quickbooksbot receives a complex accounting question that may affect tax prep. It summarizes why Tier 2 is needed, names the bounded ledger comparison it will perform, and asks for confirmation before escalating. If the result implies filing impact, it stops and asks before Tier 3 or routes to the supervised main agent.

## context-budget

**Priority**: MEDIUM  
**Full rule**: `@$AIWG_ROOT/agentic/code/addons/aiwg-utils/rules/context-budget.md`

### What It Enforces

Opt-in constraint. When `AIWG_CONTEXT_WINDOW` is set in project context, agents must respect it for parallel subagent spawning.

**Max parallel count formula**: `max(1, floor(context_window / 50000))`

| Context Window | Max Parallel |
|---------------|-------------|
| 32k | 1 |
| 64k | 1 |
| 128k | 2 |
| 200k | 4 |
| 256k | 5 |
| 512k+ | 10-20 |

Compaction guidance scales with tier: aggressive compaction at 32-64k, relaxed at 512k+.

### When It Applies

Parallel subagent spawning, task scheduling, agent loop batching, orchestrator fan-out on constrained systems. Not active unless `AIWG_CONTEXT_WINDOW` is explicitly set.

---

## diagram-generation

**Priority**: MEDIUM  
**Full rule**: `@$AIWG_ROOT/agentic/code/addons/aiwg-utils/rules/diagram-generation.md`

### What It Enforces

Diagrams are required outputs alongside major documentation artifacts. Required types by artifact:

| Artifact | Required Diagram |
|----------|-----------------|
| Software Architecture Document (SAD) | C4 context + container diagram |
| Data model / schema | ER diagram |
| API design | Sequence diagram |
| Threat model | Data Flow Diagram (DFD) |
| Deployment plan | Infrastructure topology diagram |

**Default format**: MermaidJS  
**For C4 and formal UML**: PlantUML  
**Source**: Must be committed alongside rendered output  
**Size limit**: Max 15 nodes per diagram; split into sub-diagrams if more complex

### When It Applies

Architecture documentation, threat modeling, API design, deployment planning, any artifact with visual communication needs.

---

## agent-deployment

**Priority**: MEDIUM  
**Full rule**: `@$AIWG_ROOT/agentic/code/addons/aiwg-utils/rules/agent-deployment.md`

### What It Enforces

Agent definitions require YAML frontmatter with:
- `name`: unique identifier
- `description`: what the agent does
- `model`: model to use (default or override)
- `tools`: explicit list of allowed tools
- `category`: agent type classification

Tool selection guidelines:
- Research tasks: `Read`, `Grep`, `Glob`, `WebFetch`
- Code tasks: `Read`, `Write`, `Edit`, `Bash`
- Orchestration tasks: `Task`, `TodoWrite`, `Read`
- Mixed: combine as needed, but keep the list minimal

Parallel agent execution requires agent isolation: each agent writes to its own output path to avoid conflicts.

### When It Applies

Creating agent definitions, deploying to multiple providers, selecting tools for new agents.
