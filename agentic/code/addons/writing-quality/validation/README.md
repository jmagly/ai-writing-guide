# Validation

Rules and checklists for maintaining writing quality and authenticity.

> **Note**: The `banned-patterns.md` file is **deprecated** as of December 2025. Modern frontier models naturally produce varied, authentic content without explicit pattern avoidance.
>
> **Use Instead**: The [Voice Framework](../../voice-framework/) addon with voice profiles for consistent, authentic writing.

## Files

- `banned-patterns.md` — **[DEPRECATED]** Historical reference for pattern avoidance
- `validation-checklist.md` — Pre/during/post writing checks (still relevant)

## Modern Approach

Instead of avoiding patterns, define the voice you want using voice profiles:

```bash
# Deploy voice framework
aiwg use writing

# Apply a voice profile
"Write this in technical-authority voice"
```

See the [Voice Framework README](../../voice-framework/README.md) for details.
