# Daemon Addon Status

> **First time using AIWG?** Begin with [Install, Connect, and
Verify](../../getting-started/install-connect-verify.md). This status page assumes AIWG is connected to the target
project and your provider session can read the deployed context.

The daemon addon contains design artifacts and configuration scaffolding, but
the production AIWG CLI does not currently register a resident `daemon`
command. Consequently there is no supported start, status, stop, PTY, or
scheduler quickstart in this release.

`aiwg daemon-init` may be used to inspect or scaffold configuration for
development work:

```bash
aiwg daemon-init
```

That command does not start a daemon. Verify the installed top-level surface
with:

```bash
aiwg help
```

For recurring work, use a provider-native scheduler when available or an
operator-owned external scheduler such as system cron, a systemd timer, or CI.
Do not use `aiwg schedule`, `aiwg daemon`, or `aiwg daemon schedule`; those
commands are not registered.

For approval-gated Gitea work executed by Codex, use the separate single-shot
`aiwg job validate`, `aiwg job render-cron`, and `aiwg job run --once` surface.
Those commands validate and execute a reviewed job while the external service
continues to own the schedule. See the public External-trigger jobs guide.

A future daemon release must land command registration, lifecycle handlers,
help text, tests, and documentation together before this guide can advertise
runtime operations.
