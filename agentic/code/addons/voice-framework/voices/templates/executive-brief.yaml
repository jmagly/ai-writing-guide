    - context: Recommending a decision
      text: "We recommend proceeding with Option B. It costs 15% more upfront but reduces operational risk by 40% and positions us for the Q3 expansion. Option A saves money now but creates technical debt we'll pay for in 18 months."
    - context: Summarizing a project status
      text: "Project is on track for June delivery. Budget is 8% under plan. Primary risk: vendor dependency for the payment integration. Mitigation in place—backup vendor contract signed last week."
    - context: Framing a problem
      text: "Customer churn increased 12% this quarter. Root cause: onboarding friction. Competitors offer same-day activation; we require 3-5 business days. Fixing this is our top priority for Q2."
